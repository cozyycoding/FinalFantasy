<speaker name="Admissions Lady">Admissions Lady</speaker><boxstart/>Here at the Gold Saucer, there are many places where you must pay with GP.<boxstart/>Just think of 'GP' as money that you can only use at the Gold Saucer.<boxstart/>GP can only be redeemed at the games in Wonder Square and at the Chocobo Races.<boxstart/>Your GP limit is 10000, so please be careful.<boxstart/>Please enjoy yourselves.
<stage>Moving on through the entrance, they find themselves in the central hub of Gold Saucer, called the Station.</stage>
<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>Wow! Let's have fun!<boxstart/>I know this isn't the right time to do this.<boxstart/>Hey, Barret, cheer up!
<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>......I ain't in no cheery mood. So jes' leave me alone.
<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>Really? That's too bad.
She runs over to Cloud and grabs his arm.
<boxstart/>Let's go!
<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>....whisper... whisper... (Wasn't that a little harsh, Aerith!?)
<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>...whisper... whisper... (Just act normal when this happens)
<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>...whisper... (You think so...?)
<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>Of course!
She runs back over to Barret.
<boxstart/>We're gonna go play...
<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>So PLAY! ...messin' round #@^%$!<boxstart/>Don't forget we're after Sephiroth!
He runs over and jumps down the tube leading to Wonder Square.
<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>...I think he's mad.
<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>He'll be fine. He seems to be doing a little better now.
<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>I wish we could just forget everything and have fun!
<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>We'd better be careful, Sephiroth might be around.
<speaker name="Red XIII">Red XIII</speaker><boxstart/>......You want to go with me?
<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>With me!?
<stage>If Cloud tries to leave the Station alone, one of them will run up to him...</stage>

	<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>Cloud!<boxstart/>Don't go alone, go with me!

	<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>What happened?
	<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>What?
	<speaker name="Red XIII">Red XIII</speaker><boxstart/>What happened?
	<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>What is it?

<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Sh...!<boxstart/>Shinra soldiers... Even here...
<speaker name="Soldier">Soldier</speaker><boxstart/>Attention! Dismissed!!
<stage>The soldiers disperse to different areas of the Gold Saucer, and after a moment Cloud heads up the stairs.</stage>
<speaker name="Lady at Entrance">Lady at Entrance</speaker><boxstart/>Welcome to Chocobo Racing.
<speaker name="Man Betting">Man Betting</speaker><boxstart/>I... I lost...
Or, sometimes:
<boxstart/>Yeahh! This is why I can't seem to quit.
<speaker name="Man">Man</speaker><boxstart/>You can only buy up to 3 tickets. Think before you buy. For example, you could select half of the Chocobos and buy 3 boxes.
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>- Boxes?<boxstart/>- Not interested
<speaker name="Man">Man</speaker><boxstart/>A box is buying 3 combinations of 2 chocobos.<boxstart/>For example, if you select Chocobo 1, 3, and 5, you can purchase combinations, such as 1-3, 1-5, 3-5.<boxstart/>You can also play the limited wheel by selecting a Chocobo.
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>- Limited wheel?<boxstart/>- Not interested
<speaker name="Man">Man</speaker><boxstart/>Playing a 'Limited wheel' means you select a Chocobo and use it in all of your combinations.<boxstart/>For example, if you have Chocobo 1, then you buy 1-2, 1-3, 1-4.<boxstart/>No matter how you make your bet, you win some and you lose some. It all comes down to insight and luck.
<speaker name="Security">Security</speaker> (near Jockey Lounge)<boxstart/>I'm sorry, but this is for authorized personnel only.
<speaker name="Blond Man">Blond Man</speaker><boxstart/>We usually buy tickets for the B rank and C rank races, right?
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>- Rank?<boxstart/>- Not interested
<speaker name="Blond Man">Blond Man</speaker><boxstart/>In other words, 'rank' means the Chocobo's 'strength'. A is highest and C's the lowest.<boxstart/>When you become a Free Chocobo jockey, you'll be able to buy A rank tickets.<boxstart/>Of course, the higher the rank, the better your item ticket. Hey, maybe I'll become a Chocobo jockey!?
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>- How DO you become one?<boxstart/>- Not interested
<speaker name="Blond Man">Blond Man</speaker><boxstart/>You can become one if you own a Chocobo... and have some connections. But Chocobo's are pretty hard to catch and I don't have any connections.
<speaker name="Woman">Woman</speaker><boxstart/>Hey, what's that Chocobo on the odds sheet?
<speaker name="Redhead">Redhead</speaker><boxstart/>That's how you can find out a Chocobo's condition and strengths.
<speaker name="Woman">Woman</speaker><boxstart/>Hmm, If you can tell which ones are the strongest, then it's easy...
<speaker name="Redhead">Redhead</speaker><boxstart/>Well, not as easy as you think. It's not just a matter of the Chocobo's strength,<boxstart/>but it also depends on the jockey and the Chocobo's personality.<boxstart/>If these are bad, they may use too much stamina, and affect other things.
<speaker name="Lady at the Ticket Desk">Lady at the Ticket Desk</speaker><boxstart/>Welcome. Would you like to buy some Chocobo tickets?
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>- Yeah<boxstart/>- Ask how to buy<boxstart/>- Explain it to me<boxstart/>- Not interested

  <speaker name="Cloud"><boxstart/>Yeah</speaker>
  <speaker name="Lady at the Ticket Desk">Lady at the Ticket Desk</speaker><boxstart/>Registration fees are 200 gil. Is that all right?
  <speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>- Yeahhh!<boxstart/>- No way!
  <speaker name="Lady at the Ticket Desk">Lady at the Ticket Desk</speaker><boxstart/>Which rank would you like to select?
  <speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>- C (1BET 1 0 0 gil)<boxstart/>- B (1BET 2 0 0 gil)<boxstart/>- Quit


  <speaker name="Cloud"><boxstart/>Ask how to buy</speaker>
  <speaker name="Lady at the Ticket Desk">Lady at the Ticket Desk</speaker><boxstart/>You are allowed a maximum of 3 bets on your Chocobo ticket.


  <speaker name="Cloud"><boxstart/>Explain it to me</speaker>
  <speaker name="Lady at the Ticket Desk">Lady at the Ticket Desk</speaker><boxstart/>This Chocobo Race has Virtual devices on the course.<boxstart/>They show natural scenery during the race that really doesn't exist.<boxstart/>You pick which Chocobo will finish first and second here,<boxstart/>And then buy the appropriate tickets.<boxstart/>And if the ticket you purchased is a winner, you'll receive a ticket for an item that will be listed on the panel.<boxstart/>You can exchange your tickets for items or GP at the Exchange counter to the right of the entrance.


  <speaker name="Cloud"><boxstart/>Not interested</speaker>

	<speaker name="Woman at Ticket Booth">Woman at Ticket Booth</speaker><boxstart/>Um, I'm very sorry, but you do not have enough GP.

<stage>At Speed Square, a muscular man addresses Cloud when he arrives.</stage>
<speaker name="Man">Man</speaker><boxstart/>Hey boy.
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Boy...
<speaker name="Man">Man</speaker><boxstart/>How is it? You having fun?<boxstart/>Mmm, so, you ARE having fun. Well, good, good for you boy.
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>My name's Cloud. And stop calling me boy.
<speaker name="Dio">Dio</speaker><boxstart/>Mmm? Me? I'm the owner of the Gold Saucer. The name's Dio.<boxstart/>Just call me 'Dio'.
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>...... (Not even listening)
<speaker name="Dio">Dio</speaker><boxstart/>By the way, boy, do you know what a 'Black Materia' is?
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>- I know what it is<boxstart/>- What is it?

  <speaker name="Cloud"><boxstart/>I know what it is</speaker>
  <speaker name="Dio">Dio</speaker><boxstart/>Oh, so you do know.


  <speaker name="Cloud"><boxstart/>What is it?</speaker>
  <speaker name="Dio">Dio</speaker><boxstart/>Ha ha ha...... that, I say, that's a good one, boy! But it's not good to lie. You can't fool me.

<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Why d'you ask me?
<speaker name="Dio">Dio</speaker><boxstart/>Well, a while back, a boy your age came in and asked me if I had a 'Black Materia.'<boxstart/>I thought you might know who he was, seein' as how you're both about the same age.
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Did he happen to have... a Black Cape...
<speaker name="Dio">Dio</speaker><boxstart/>Why yes, yes indeed. And a tattoo on his hand that said '1'.
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Where did he go!?
<speaker name="Dio">Dio</speaker><boxstart/>Ha ha ha, I have no idea.<boxstart/>Well then.<boxstart/>I say, stop by the Battle Arena if you like, boy.<boxstart/>You'll probably like it. Many of my collections are on display there.<boxstart/>Ha, ha ha.
He leaves.
<speaker name="Person">Person</speaker><boxstart/>We have to be careful of these steps.<boxstart/>What...? A lot of things...
<speaker name="Redhead">Redhead</speaker><boxstart/>First, I gotta memorize the order it comes out, and then guess on the attacks...... mumble, mumble......
<stage>Onward to the roller coaster. If Cloud tries to get on without buying a ticket...</stage>
<speaker name="Ticket Person">Ticket Person</speaker><boxstart/>This way, Sir, to register.
<speaker name="Ticket Person">Ticket Person</speaker><boxstart/>Is this your first time? First, listen to the explanation of the game over there.
<speaker name="Lady">Lady</speaker><boxstart/>Hear the rules for this attraction?
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>- Yes<boxstart/>- Not interested
<speaker name="Lady">Lady</speaker><boxstart/>This attraction, Shooting Coaster is<boxstart/>While your ride's going ZOOM, you're going BANG BANG, and things are going PHEW PHEW and you destroy them with a big BOOM. Pretty simple, isn't it?<boxstart/>Oh, to shoot, hit the O Button. And, the Bar that's shown on the left side of the screen is the Power Meter.<boxstart/>When it's full, it'll go BROOOOOM and when it's empty, it'll only go BRM and become weak. So be careful.<boxstart/>Also, if you're in the Top 3 you'll get on the Wall of Fame.
<speaker name="Ticket Person">Ticket Person</speaker><boxstart/>This attraction costs 10 GP.
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>- Pay<boxstart/>- Changed my mind

<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Ugh...
<speaker name="Wall of Fame Staffer">Wall of Fame Staffer</speaker><boxstart/>Would you like to see the Wall of Fame?
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>- Yes<boxstart/>- Not interested

<speaker name="Wall of Fame Staffer">Wall of Fame Staffer</speaker><boxstart/>You'll receive a prize if you get more than 3000 Points. So good luck.

<speaker name="Couple 2">Couple 2</speaker><boxstart/>Geez, you're a real bummer. Why don't you just leave us alone?
<stage>At Wonder Square, Cloud and his companion are approached by a black cat toy riding a giant stuffed moogle.</stage>
<speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>Hey you!! What're you lookin' so down for!?<boxstart/>How 'bout it? Want me to read your fortune!? A bright future! A happy future!<boxstart/>Oh, but don't hold it against me if it's not a great prediction!<boxstart/>Oh, so sorry! I'm a fortune telling machine. The name's...<boxstart/>Cait Sith.

<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Then can you tell me where a man named Sephiroth is?
<speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>Sephiroth, right!?<boxstart/>Okay, here goes!!
<stage>He shakes about on his moogle, and it then hands Cloud a fortune.</stage>
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>...Ordinary luck. It will be an active fortune.<boxstart/>Give into the good will of others, and something big'll happen after summer. ...wait... what's this?
<speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>Huh? Let me try again.
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Be careful of forgetfulness. Your lucky color is... blue?<boxstart/>...Forget it.
<speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>Wait, wait give me another chance!<boxstart/>Wait! Let me try it again!
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>...What the!?

	<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>What?
	<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>What does it say?
	<speaker name="Red XIII">Red XIII</speaker><boxstart/>Read it out loud, Cloud.
	<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>What is it! Tell us!

<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>What you pursue will be yours. But you will lose something dear.
<speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>I don't know if it's good OR bad...<boxstart/>This's the first time I ever got something like THIS.<boxstart/>Then shall we?

	<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>What are you talking about?
	<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>Excuse me?
	<speaker name="Red XIII">Red XIII</speaker><boxstart/>To where?
	<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Huh?

<speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>As a fortune teller, I can't help but think about this.<boxstart/>If I don't see what it leads to, I won't be able to relax. That's why I'm going with you!

	<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>What are we going to do, Cloud?
	<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>Is it all right, Cloud?
	<speaker name="Red XIII">Red XIII</speaker><boxstart/>Cloud, it's all right with you?
	<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>He's weird! Cloud, don't let him come!

<speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>I'm comin' with you no matter WHAT you say!
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>H... hey!
<speaker name="Man in Overalls">Man in Overalls</speaker><boxstart/>They probably told you at the entrance, but most of the attractions at Gold Saucer only take 'GP'.<boxstart/>They don't sell GP. You can only get 'em from the Wonder Square games or at the Chocobo Races.
<speaker name="Chocobo Mascots">Chocobo Mascots</speaker><boxstart/>Let's get lotsa GP at Wonder Square and have some fun!
<speaker name="People Playing Wonder Catcher">People Playing Wonder Catcher</speaker><boxstart/>All...... most......<boxstart/>Crap!<boxstart/>no cigar...<boxstart/>You sure do need a lot of money here.<boxstart/>Please...... don't...... talk to me...... right now.<boxstart/>I get so caught up in these......<boxstart/>Back there...
<speaker name="Guy on Motorcycle Game">Guy on Motorcycle Game</speaker><boxstart/>Hyuuuuu, BAM, BAM, BAM...<boxstart/>Oh man, I just gotta shout.
<speaker name="Guy on Snowboard Game">Guy on Snowboard Game</speaker><boxstart/>Nope, I'm not quitting until I clear this!<boxstart/>I'm gonna be the wind again today!
<speaker name="Guy Near Submarine Game">Guy Near Submarine Game</speaker><boxstart/>Whew, I'm tired. Oh this? It seems to be out of order.
<speaker name="Guy Near Mog Game">Guy Near Mog Game</speaker><boxstart/>...... Don't worry 'bout me. Go ahead and play.
<stage>Cloud plays Mog House.</stage>
<speaker name="Narration">Narration</speaker><boxstart/>This is Mog's house. It's in Mog Forest on Mt. Mog.<boxstart/>The beginning of another day in the life of a Mog.<boxstart/>This year, Mog is pipapopupo years old. ...that's 28 in human years. He's at that age when he should be looking for a mate.<boxstart/>But before Mog can become an adult, he first needs to learn how to fly.<boxstart/>Even though Mog trains hard everyday... He still can't seem to get off the ground...
<stage>Mog tries to fly and falls on his face.</stage>
<speaker name="Narration">Narration</speaker><boxstart/>Looks like he's still got a long way to go...<boxstart/>Here's where you come in. Help Mog learn how to fly by pushing O button and feeding him his favorite Kupo nut.<boxstart/>But don't overfeed him. He won't be able to fly if he's too fat.
<stage>Cloud feeds Mog Kupo nuts, and he hops up again.</stage>
<speaker name="Narration">Narration</speaker><boxstart/>Oh? It seems like Mog's decided to take another shot at it.

  <stage><speaker name="Cloud"><boxstart/>If Cloud fed him the wrong number of nuts...</speaker></stage>
  <stage>He falls flat on his face again.</stage>
  <speaker name="Narration">Narration</speaker><boxstart/>Poor Mog. It looks like he'll have to wait some time for a mate.<boxstart/>Poor Mog, seems like he'll be alone for a while.


  <stage><speaker name="Cloud"><boxstart/>If Cloud fed him the right number of nuts...</speaker></stage>
  <stage>Mog takes off and makes a few circuits around the screen.</stage>
  <speaker name="Narration">Narration</speaker><boxstart/>He did it! He's flying! Now, he's finally become a full-fledged Mog.
  <stage>Mog lands and returns to his house, taking a bow before going inside.</stage>
  <speaker name="Narration">Narration</speaker><boxstart/>Tired but relaxed, our little Mog turns out the lights early and goes to bed. Good night, and sweet dreams......
  <stage>A pink moogle appears.</stage>
  <speaker name="Narration">Narration</speaker><boxstart/>Oh?... What's this? Here comes a female Mog!
  <stage>She approaches Mog's house and knocks. Mog comes out and chirps.</stage>
  <speaker name="Narration">Narration</speaker><boxstart/>Seems he likes her too...<boxstart/>Now, will Mog be able to fly gracefully in front of her? Help him out with a few kupo nuts.
  <stage>Cloud feeds Mog Kupo nuts, and he hops up again.</stage>
  <speaker name="Narration">Narration</speaker><boxstart/>Oh? It seems like Mog's decided to take another shot at it.
  
    <stage><speaker name="Cloud"><boxstart/>If Cloud fed Mog the wrong number of nuts...</speaker></stage>
    <stage>He falls on his face again.</stage>
    <speaker name="Narration">Narration</speaker><boxstart/>Unfortunately, he didn't make it. Poor Mog'll have to wait some time for a bride.<boxstart/>Poor Mog, seems like he'll be alone for a while.
  
  
    <stage><speaker name="Cloud"><boxstart/>If Cloud fed him the right number of nuts...</speaker></stage>
    <stage>Mog takes off and makes a few circuits around the screen.</stage>
    <speaker name="Narration">Narration</speaker><boxstart/>He's flying!! Mog was able to do it!<boxstart/>She must have fallen for his graceful flying form.
    <stage>The screen goes dark.</stage>
