Gongaga - Afraid to Go On

<stage>Cloud wakes in the Gongaga inn. Barret and Tifa are at his bedside.</stage>
<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>You look like you was havin' a nightmare.<boxstart/>How are you feeling?
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>- I seem to be OK<boxstart/>- Not good<boxstart/>- Don't really know

  <speaker name="Cloud"><boxstart/>I seem to be OK</speaker>
  <speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>That's good. Man, I didn't know what was gonna happen.


  <speaker name="Cloud"><boxstart/>Not good</speaker>
  <speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Oh... Better keep it to yourself.


  <speaker name="Cloud"><boxstart/>Don't really know</speaker>
  <speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>I guess that's right. Well, don't worry too much about it.

<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>You know, Cloud. Aerith is gone.
<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Everyone's out looking for Aerith.
<stage>Cloud sits up.</stage>
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>......City of the Ancients. Aerith is headed there.
<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>By herself!? Why did she go by herself!?<boxstart/>Hey, we're goin' too.
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Only the Ancients, only Aerith can save us from Meteor...
<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>Then we must go. What'll we do if something happens to Aerith? If Sephiroth finds her, she's in trouble.
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Sephiroth... already knows.
<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Hey! Why are you still sittin' around?
<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>Let's go, Cloud.
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>No.
He clutches his head.
<boxstart/>I might lose it again.<boxstart/>If Sephiroth comes near me<boxstart/>I might......
<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Yeah, godammit! It's 'cuz of you that Sephiroth got the Black Materia in the first place. It's your damn fault!
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>My fault?
<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>I know you got problems... hell, we all do. But you don't even understand yourself.<boxstart/>But you gotta understand that there ain't no gettin' offa this train we're on, till we get to the end of the line.
<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>Cloud, we came this far... Aren't you going to settle up with Sephiroth?
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker> (shaking his head)<boxstart/>No...<boxstart/>I'm afraid.<boxstart/>If this keeps up, I may go crazy!<boxstart/>I'm afraid...
<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Just a damn jackass, that's what you are...<boxstart/>Yo, jes' think about it... How many people in this world do ya think really understand themselves?<boxstart/>People get depressed in life because they don't know what's up.<boxstart/>But, they go on living. They don't run away... Isn't that how it is?
He walks out of the room.
<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>Cloud... you'll come with us, right? I believe in you.
She walks out after Barret.
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>What... am I supposed to do?<boxstart/>Pull out of here?<boxstart/>Pull out? ...To where?
<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker> (from the next room)<boxstart/>Cloud...
<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Wait a minute, Tifa. Give him a little time.<boxstart/>He has to decide this on his own.<boxstart/>You believe in Cloud... right?
<stage>He leaves the inn, and Tifa follows reluctantly.</stage>
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>......I'm afraid to find out the truth...? But...... why?
He gets to his feet.
<speaker name="Innkeeper">Innkeeper</speaker><boxstart/>You awake?<boxstart/>Those people were so worried that they stayed by your side until you woke up.<boxstart/>You sure do have good friends.
<stage>Cloud walks outside.</stage>
<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>Cloud...
<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Hey, how are you?<boxstart/>I just wanna know, which is it gonna be?<boxstart/>You wanna find out about yourself? Or are you afraid to find out?<boxstart/>Either way, you stay around here and about all you can do is worry about it.<boxstart/>Even if you do go nuts again when you see Sephiroth... If it happens, it happens.<boxstart/>I'll go upside your spikey white head and bring you back to normal!
<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>Cloud, it'll be all right. We're all with you.
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>But...
<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>If it happens, it happens. Don't worry 'bout it.
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>...You're... right. ......He's right, isn't he?
<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>Come on, let's go and find Aerith...?
<stage>Together, they leave Gongaga to search for Aerith.</stage>
