Sector 5 - Aerith's Story

Aerith's House: Elmyra Explains
Wall Market: A Golden Shiny Wire of Hope

<stage>Cloud and the others arrive in Sector 5.</stage>
<speaker name="Person Outside the Pipe">Person Outside the Pipe</speaker><boxstart/>Even with all that commotion, you went on like nothing happened. You must really been through the mill to get that.
<stage>Inside the Materia Shop...</stage>
<speaker name="Materia Shopkeeper">Materia Shopkeeper</speaker><boxstart/>Living in a place like this, you could live out several lives, and it still wouldn't be enough!<boxstart/>Well, how about some materia? Make some money and then scramble out of here!
<speaker name="Woman Walking Around">Woman Walking Around</speaker><boxstart/>Never thought that would come tumbling down. Maybe I better walk around looking up from now on.
<stage>Inside the nearby house...</stage>
<speaker name="Man">Man</speaker><boxstart/>The hell's up with that!? I don't care if they're AVALANCHE or Avant-garde or whatever you call them. Anyone who brings the plates down on us is nuts!!
This just in. An accident today...<boxstart/>...the worst in the history of the metropolis. But thanks to the quick response by those in charge, there were no civilian casualties.<boxstart/>The cause of the accident is unclear at this time, however, according to some sources it is believed to have something to do with the terrorist activities of the group, AVALANCHE.
<stage>Upstairs, if Cloud took the kid's 5 gil earlier...</stage>
<speaker name="Kid">Kid</speaker><boxstart/>sniff......... sniff......... ......'n' I hid it...... so nuthin' like this...... would ever happen......... sniff......
<stage>Back outside...</stage>
<speaker name="Kid from the Weapons Shop">Kid from the Weapons Shop</speaker><boxstart/>...sniff... sniff...<boxstart/>First there was a rumbling...... ...then cracking... and then ker-blaMM!!...<boxstart/>...I was so scared... sniff...
<speaker name="Person in Blue">Person in Blue</speaker><boxstart/>You finally think you're making a living in the pits of Midgar, and then a big piece of scrap like that falls down here... what's next?
<speaker name="Man in Straw Hat">Man in Straw Hat</speaker><boxstart/>Yeah, that's right! But, even so, where could we move to now...?
<stage>Inside the Weapons Shop...</stage>
<speaker name="Man">Man</speaker><boxstart/>...sure is loud outside. Wonder what's happening?
<speaker name="Weapons Shopkeeper">Weapons Shopkeeper</speaker><boxstart/>You never know what's going to happen! It's a crazy world,<boxstart/>so you'd better at least have a weapon you can depend on! Am I right or what?
<stage>They continue onward to Aerith's house, where Elmyra is there to receive them.</stage>
<speaker name="Elmyra">Elmyra</speaker><boxstart/>Cloud...... wasn't it?<boxstart/>It's about Aerith, isn't it?
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>...Sorry. The Shinra have her.
<speaker name="Elmyra">Elmyra</speaker><boxstart/>I know. They took her from here.
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>They were here?
<speaker name="Elmyra">Elmyra</speaker><boxstart/>That's what Aerith wanted...
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Why is Shinra after Aerith?
<speaker name="Elmyra">Elmyra</speaker><boxstart/>Aerith is an Ancient. The sole survivor.
<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>...What did you say? But, aren't you her mother?
<speaker name="Elmyra">Elmyra</speaker><boxstart/>...Not her real mother. Oh... it must have been 15 years ago...<boxstart/>...during the war. My husband was sent to the front. Some far away place called Wutai.
One day, I went to the station because I got a letter saying he was coming home on leave.<boxstart/>
<stage>In the flashback, Elmyra is waiting at the Sector 7 train station. A pair who look very much like Biggs and Jessie is hanging around at the lamp post like a couple. A man gets off the train and picks up his girlfriend. Another man gets off, and his wife picks him up. No one else gets off. Elmyra runs up to the station man who shakes his head.</stage>
My husband never came back.<boxstart/>I wonder if something happened to him?<boxstart/>No, I'm sure his leave was just canceled.<boxstart/>I went to the station everyday.<boxstart/>Then, one day.........<boxstart/>
<stage>Aerith's mother Ifalna is lying at the bottom of the steps, and a seven-year-old Aerith stands nearby crying. Elmyra runs over.</stage>
You used to see this sort of thing a lot during the war.<boxstart/>Her last words were, "Please take Aerith somewhere safe."<boxstart/>My husband never came back. I had no child. I was probably lonely. So I decided to take her home with me.<boxstart/>Aerith and I became close very quickly. That child loved to talk. She used to talk to me about everything.<boxstart/>She told me she escaped from some kind of research laboratory somewhere. And that her mother had already returned to the planet, so she wasn't lonely... and many other things.
<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Returned to the planet?
<speaker name="Elmyra">Elmyra</speaker><boxstart/>I didn't know what she meant. I asked if she meant a star in the sky,<boxstart/>But she said it was this planet... She was a mysterious child in many ways.
<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>Mom.<boxstart/>Please don't cry.
<speaker name="Elmyra">Elmyra</speaker><boxstart/>Aerith just blurted that out all of a sudden. When I asked her if something happened...<boxstart/>
<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>Someone dear to you has just died.<boxstart/>His spirit was coming to see you, but he already returned to the planet.
<speaker name="Elmyra">Elmyra</speaker><boxstart/>At that time I didn't believe her.<boxstart/>But...<boxstart/>Several days later... We received a notice saying my husband died...<boxstart/>...and that's how it was.<boxstart/>A lot had happened, but we were happy. Until one day...<boxstart/>
<stage>Tseng of the Turks has come to the house. A young Aerith is hiding behind Elmyra.</stage><boxstart/>
<speaker name="Tseng">Tseng</speaker><boxstart/>We want you to return Aerith to us. We've been searching for her for a long time.<boxstart/>
<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>No! Never!<boxstart/>
<speaker name="Tseng">Tseng</speaker><boxstart/>Aerith, you're a very special child. You are of special blood.<boxstart/>Your real mother was an 'Ancient'.
<speaker name="Elmyra">Elmyra</speaker><boxstart/>Of course I heard it. That she was an Ancient.<boxstart/>
<speaker name="Tseng">Tseng</speaker><boxstart/>The Ancients will lead us to a land of supreme happiness.<boxstart/>Aerith will be able to bring happiness to all those in the slums.<boxstart/>That is why the Shinra would like Aerith's cooperation......<boxstart/>
<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>He's wrong! I'm not an Ancient! I'm not!<boxstart/>
<speaker name="Tseng">Tseng</speaker><boxstart/>But Aerith, surely you hear voices sometimes when you're all alone?<boxstart/>
<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>No, I don't!
<speaker name="Elmyra">Elmyra</speaker><boxstart/>But I knew. I knew about her mysterious powers...<boxstart/>She tried so hard to hide it, so I acted as though I never noticed.
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>It's amazing how she's avoided the Shinra for all these years...
<speaker name="Elmyra">Elmyra</speaker><boxstart/>The Shinra needed her, So I guess they wouldn't harm her.
<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>But why now......
<speaker name="Elmyra">Elmyra</speaker><boxstart/>She brought a little girl here with her.<boxstart/>On the way here, Tseng found them. She probably couldn't get away fast enough.<boxstart/>She decided to go to the Shinra in exchange for the little girl's safety.
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Must be Marlene.
<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Marlene!! Aerith was caught because of Marlene!?<boxstart/>I'm sorry. Marlene's my daughter. I'm... really... sorry...
<speaker name="Elmyra">Elmyra</speaker><boxstart/>You're her father!? How in the world could you ever leave a child alone like that!?
<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>...please don't start with that. I think about it all the time. What would happen to Marlene, if I...<boxstart/>But you gotta understand somethin'... ...I don't got an answer. I wanna be with Marlene... But I gotta fight.<boxstart/>'Cause if I don't... the planet's gonna die.<boxstart/>So I'm gonna keep fightin'!<boxstart/>But, I'm worried 'bout Marlene. I really just wanna be with her... always.<boxstart/>See? I'm goin' in circles, now.
<speaker name="Elmyra">Elmyra</speaker><boxstart/>...I think I understand what you're saying... She's upstairs asleep, Why don't you go and see her.
<stage>Barret goes upstairs.</stage>
<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>It's my fault... I was the one who got Aerith involved in this.
<speaker name="Elmyra">Elmyra</speaker><boxstart/>Don't say that. Aerith doesn't think that.
<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>I feel so depressed.
<speaker name="Elmyra">Elmyra</speaker><boxstart/>...sigh...
<stage>Upstairs, Barret is hugging Marlene to him.</stage>
<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>I'm so glad...... I'm so glad you're all right...
<speaker name="Marlene">Marlene</speaker><boxstart/>Daddy, don't cry. Your whiskers hurt!
<stage>Cloud moves to leave without saying anything, but Barret notices him.</stage>
<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Cloud!<boxstart/>You gonna go help Aerith, right? She's done so much for me...<boxstart/>If it's the Shinra you're dealin' with, I can't just sit here! I'm comin', too!
<speaker name="Marlene">Marlene</speaker><boxstart/>Guess what? Guess what? Aerith was asking me lots of questions.<boxstart/>Like what kind of person Cloud is. I bet she likes you, Cloud!
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>- I don't know<boxstart/>- Let's hope so

  <speaker name="Cloud"><boxstart/>I don't know</speaker>
  <speaker name="Marlene">Marlene</speaker><boxstart/>Stupid!


  <speaker name="Cloud"><boxstart/>Let's hope so</speaker>
  <speaker name="Marlene">Marlene</speaker><boxstart/>I won't tell Tifa!

<stage>Cloud goes back downstairs and heads for the door.</stage>
<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>You're going after Aerith, right?
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Yeah.
<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>I'm coming with you.
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>We're going right into Shinra Headquarters. ...You gotta be prepared for the worst.
<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>I know.<boxstart/>Right now, I feel I have to push myself to the limit.<boxstart/>If I stayed here... I'll go crazy.
<stage>Barret comes thundering down.</stage>
<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Sorry, but can you take care of Marlene a bit longer?
<speaker name="Elmyra">Elmyra</speaker><boxstart/>Yes, I don't mind.
<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>This place is dangerous now. You better go somewhere else.
<speaker name="Elmyra">Elmyra</speaker><boxstart/>...You're right. But promise me that you'll come back to her. Don't get yourself killed.
<stage>Barret turns to Cloud and Tifa. They all nod and run outside.</stage>
<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>How do we get to the Shinra Building?
<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>There ain't no train that goes up there anymore...
<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>......<boxstart/>Well, let's just go to Wall Market. We might be able to find something there.
<stage>Back inside the house...</stage>
<speaker name="Elmyra">Elmyra</speaker><boxstart/>I mean it, come back to her. Don't get yourself killed. 
<stage>Cloud and the others head for Wall Market to search the area for something useful. At the Honey Bee Inn...</stage>
<speaker name="Punk">Punk</speaker><boxstart/>Hey!! It's you!!<boxstart/>Sorry, but I already heard about you.<boxstart/>In addition to dressing like a woman, it seems you like to smash and grind things.<boxstart/>We only let cultured customers in! Got it? Then you'd better leave!
<speaker name="Kid by Cat Statue">Kid by Cat Statue</speaker><boxstart/>It came down from the sky.<boxstart/>But the old guy who likes tanks took all of it away. I wanted some too.
<speaker name="Punk">Punk</speaker><boxstart/>I never believed that Sector 7 would ever come down.
<speaker name="Man Outside Restaurant">Man Outside Restaurant</speaker><boxstart/>According to that guy with the tank, if you're strong enough, anyone can make it to the top plate.<boxstart/>So, build your strength by having a plate of our food.
<speaker name="Man Outside Dress Shop">Man Outside Dress Shop</speaker><boxstart/>That was scary...
<stage>Inside the Clothing Shop...</stage>
<speaker name="Clothing Shop Owner">Clothing Shop Owner</speaker><boxstart/>You're dressed normal today. If something else interesting comes up, let me in on it.
<speaker name="Man Cooking Outside">Man Cooking Outside</speaker><boxstart/>Phew, it's all dusty ever since the sky came down. I'll have to start over.
<speaker name="Man 1">Man 1</speaker><boxstart/>Is this pile of trash getting bigger?
<speaker name="Man 2">Man 2</speaker><boxstart/>Yes, I think so.<boxstart/>A lot of things came falling down when the Sector 7 pillar fell.
<speaker name="Man 1">Man 1</speaker><boxstart/>Right, right, you're right. The owner of the Weapons Shop scavenged all the stuff that came falling down.
<speaker name="Man 2">Man 2</speaker><boxstart/>Oh is that why? He seems pretty suspicious these days.
<speaker name="Man 1">Man 1</speaker><boxstart/>Oh, you mean he went out to the Plate cross section next to the Don's Mansion, right?
<speaker name="Man 2">Man 2</speaker><boxstart/>Oh, you know! I wonder what he's doing?
<speaker name="Man 1">Man 1</speaker><boxstart/>Yeah! It gives me the chills.
<stage>Inside the gym...</stage>
<speaker name="Man Using Punching Bag">Man Using Punching Bag</speaker><boxstart/>More strength.<boxstart/>I bet you could climb all the way up to the upper plate if you used that pipe.<boxstart/>Don't you know? The old man at the Weapon shop can tell you more about it.
<stage>In the bar...</stage>
<speaker name="Redhead">Redhead</speaker><boxstart/>Scary, isn't it? You just never know when the plate might come crashing down.
<speaker name="Redhead 2">Redhead 2</speaker><boxstart/>Yeah. I'd like to climb up to the plate if I could.
<stage>In the Weapons Shop...</stage>
<speaker name="Weapons Shop Owner">Weapons Shop Owner</speaker><boxstart/>You goin' up to the plate? You better have a Battery.
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>You're gonna sell me something you just found?
<speaker name="Weapons Shop Owner">Weapons Shop Owner</speaker><boxstart/>Hey, you knew? But I repaired it, so it's all right.
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Why do I need a battery to climb up to the plate?
<speaker name="Weapons Shop Owner">Weapons Shop Owner</speaker><boxstart/>You'll find out when you get there. How 'bout 100 Gil for each?
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>......<boxstart/>- All right, I'll take them<boxstart/>- I think you're full of it

  <speaker name="Cloud"><boxstart/>All right, I'll take them</speaker>
  Received "Batteries"!


  <speaker name="Cloud"><boxstart/>I think you're full of it</speaker>
  <speaker name="Weapons Shop Owner">Weapons Shop Owner</speaker><boxstart/>All right then, go see for yourself. You'll be back again.

<speaker name="Kid">Kid</speaker><boxstart/>Wanna see somethin' awesome? Follow me!
<stage>A trio of kids runs into the alley beyond Corneo's mansion. Corneo's mansion is empty, except for Kotch strapped to a table in the basement.</stage>
<speaker name="Kotch">Kotch</speaker><boxstart/>Hey! You're... not them... you're...<boxstart/>Please, help me!
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>- Help him<boxstart/>- Leave him

  <speaker name="Cloud"><boxstart/>Help him</speaker>
  <speaker name="Kotch">Kotch</speaker><boxstart/>Thanks!<boxstart/>You know what? After you left, some Shinra guys forced themselves in here saying things like 'information leaked' and 'good for nothing'.<boxstart/>They took Don somewhere and that's it...... I'm still here.<boxstart/>Oops! They're here again... I'm outta here! SEE ya
  <stage>He runs off.</stage>


  <speaker name="Cloud"><boxstart/>Leave him</speaker>
  <speaker name="Kotch">Kotch</speaker><boxstart/>I... I was just following the Don's orders! Help me!

<stage>Into the alley beyond the mansion...</stage>
<speaker name="Girl">Girl</speaker><boxstart/>Everyone climbed up this wire. Looks scary...... Brrr.
<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>Can we climb it?
<speaker name="Girl">Girl</speaker><boxstart/>Yeah. It leads to the Upper World.
<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Awright! We'll climb this wire!
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>There's no way we can do this. You know how far it goes up?
<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>There IS a way! Look! What's that look like?
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Just a normal wire.
<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Oh yeah? Well to me it looks like a golden shiny wire of hope.
<stage>They all look up.</stage>
<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>You're right. This is the only way to save Aerith...
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Ok, that was a bad analogy, but, Barret, I understand how you feel.<boxstart/>Let's go!
<stage>Cloud and the others start up the wire. At the top of the wall, the other two kids are looking at the rubble of Sector 7.</stage>
<speaker name="Kid 2">Kid 2</speaker><boxstart/>Oh man! This is horrible...
<speaker name="Kid">Kid</speaker><boxstart/>Hey, scary, huh? Dad told me that it's the Shinra's doing.
<stage>Cloud climbs past them to where the wire ends and there is a tangle of piping and train tracks.</stage>
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Maybe if I put a battery in...<boxstart/>The propeller might work.<boxstart/>I guess I'll just have to believe the shopkeeper.
Cloud puts a battery in and the propeller spins, ending in a different position and opening up a path. He continues on up.
<boxstart/>Need a battery here, too.<boxstart/>Looks like the only way is to jump onto that bar.<boxstart/>Should make it if I jump before it comes too close. (use OK button to jump)
If he misses it he'll say either "Jumped too soon..." or "Jumped too late..."
<stage>Making their way through the tangle of debris left by Sector 7's destruction, Cloud and the others eventually reach the upper plate...</stage>
