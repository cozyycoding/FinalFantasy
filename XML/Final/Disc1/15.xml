Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town

Corel Mountains
North Corel
The Ropeway

<stage>Cloud the others make their way through the Corel Mountains. On the way up Mt. Corel, they run across an old man.</stage>
<speaker name="Old Man">Old Man</speaker><boxstart/>Whew!!<boxstart/>Hey!<boxstart/>You're actually talking to me.
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>What is it?
<speaker name="Old Man">Old Man</speaker><boxstart/>I just passed a guy in a black cloak back there.<boxstart/>I just tried to tell him that it's dangerous up ahead, and he ignored me!
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Sephiroth...

	<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>............ahh.
	<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>There was a black-cloaked guy here, too?
	<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>Let's hurry on.
	<speaker name="Red XIII">Red XIII</speaker><boxstart/>Hmm...... I'm moving on ahead...
	<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Oh gawd, what a drag!!

<speaker name="Old Man">Old Man</speaker><boxstart/>It's dangerous up ahead. Be careful on your way.<boxstart/>If any strangers should greet you warmly while traveling, make sure to greet them back.<boxstart/>Whew! I guess that's the fun of being on the road.
<stage>Cloud and his party continue up Mt. Corel and on past the Mako reactor. They follow the train tracks through the mountains and find the others gathered near a raised bridge.</stage>

	<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>Cloud!!<boxstart/>I was just wishing you were here!<boxstart/>Unless someone lets down the bridge, we're stuck.<boxstart/>Cloud should be able to do something.<boxstart/>But let's take a breather first.
	<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>OH!! Cloud! That's it!<boxstart/>We can't go on until the bridge is let down.<boxstart/>I think there's a switch in that shack over there...<boxstart/>But there's too many monsters around and I'm beat...
	<speaker name="Red XIII">Red XIII</speaker><boxstart/>Wha? Oh, it's you.<boxstart/>There seems to be an instrument in that hut that manipulates this bridge.<boxstart/>Perhaps it's best if we rest a moment.

<stage>An arrow appears, pointing to the shack and proclaiming, "The shack is here!! (^^);"</stage>
<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>Come on, Cloud. Let's rest a minute.
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Ok, then...<boxstart/>- PHS<boxstart/>- Let's move on!
<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>......whew!
<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>I'm sure glad I'm with you, Cloud!
<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>I'm beat...
<speaker name="Red XIII">Red XIII</speaker><boxstart/>What...?
<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>I'm pooped!
<stage>Cloud heads for the shack. If Aerith or Tifa are not in the party, they start jumping up and down as Cloud passes on the track above.</stage>
<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>Oh, Cloud!! Good Luck!!
<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>Cloud!! Go Cloud!! Go!!
<stage>Further down, Cloud enters the tiny shack.</stage>
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>OW!! Sure is tight in here...<boxstart/>Come on, Cloud, don't let it get to you. Let's see... this is it.<boxstart/>Maybe if I turn this...<boxstart/>...something should happen.<boxstart/>- Do it<boxstart/>- Leave it
<stage>Cloud turns the switch, and the others run across the bridge to go on ahead. Climbing up from near the shack, the party finds a bird's nest full of Phoenix Down.</stage>

	<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Haaeyy!
	<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>How cute!!
	<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>Yes!! ...how cute.
	<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Yeow! What a rock!!
	<speaker name="Red XIII">Red XIII</speaker><boxstart/>huff... huff...

<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>What should we do?<boxstart/>- Take the damn treasure<boxstart/>- Leave it where it is

  <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>Take the damn treasure
  Times are tough... I'm taking the treasure.
  
	  <speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Haeey!! Baaeby!!
	  <speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>Cloud......
	  <speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>Oh! Cloud! Your hair looks like a Chocobo!
	  <speaker name="Red XIII">Red XIII</speaker><boxstart/>Glu... glug...!
	  <speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Come to mommy!!
  
  <stage>Cloud and the others fight the mother Cokatolis.</stage>
  Received 10 "Phoenix Down"!


  <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>Leave it where it is
  ...it's got nothing to do with us. Just forget about it.
  
	  <speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Haeey!! Baaeby!!
	  <speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>Cloud......
	  <speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>Right! That was admirable of you.
	  <speaker name="Red XIII">Red XIII</speaker><boxstart/>Glu... glug...!
	  <speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>You kiddin'?
  

<stage>They return to cross the bridge and move on. Inside a cave, there's a man lying in his bulldozer.</stage>
<speaker name="Man">Man</speaker><boxstart/>Hey! How'd you ever wind up around here?<boxstart/>Look, I'm sorry but, I can't do a thing for you!<boxstart/>Oh boy!! Corel sure has gone to pot. It used to be a famous coal mining town!<boxstart/>They say there were more jobs than you could shake a...<boxstart/>Well, you get the picture!<boxstart/>Now, it's nothing but a miserable pit! Me, my bulldozer... everything's out of work.<boxstart/>Got no job... I can't even show my face. 'Bout all that's left for me is to just live in this hole all day.
<stage>The train tracks eventually dead-end into the camp of North Corel.</stage>

  <stage><speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>If Barret is in the party...</stage>
  <speaker name="Man">Man</speaker><boxstart/>You, you're...<boxstart/>Hey!! He's back!
  He runs off.
  <speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Wait here...
  <stage>Barret walks over to where a trio of men have gathered. One of them punches him.</stage>
  <speaker name="Men">Men</speaker><boxstart/>Well, lookey here! Never thought I'd ever see your face again.<boxstart/>Those people over there, they with you?<boxstart/>Well, I feel sorry for 'em! Hangin' around a walkin' death sentence like Barret.


  <stage><speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>If Barret is not in the party...</stage>
  <stage>Cloud and the others find him already accosted by the three men. One of them punches him.</stage>
  <speaker name="Men">Men</speaker><boxstart/>Well, lookey here! Never thought I'd ever see your face again.<boxstart/>They kick you out of another town or somethin'?<boxstart/>You destroy everything you touch.

<speaker name="Men">Men</speaker><boxstart/>You got a lot of balls comin' back here!<boxstart/>Look at this place! It's all your fault North Corel turned into a garbage heap!<boxstart/>Why doncha say something!?<boxstart/>Or did ya forget what you done here already?
<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>...I'm sorry...
<speaker name="Man">Man</speaker><boxstart/>^%$#! You ain't even worth the effort.<boxstart/>Don't waste your time talkin' to that Techno-freak!
<stage>The three men nod and disperse. Barret walks back to the others.</stage>
<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>You heard 'em... It's my fault this town was... destroyed...
<stage>They let it be and continue through the town.</stage>
<speaker name="Big Man">Big Man</speaker><boxstart/>YOU know who's responsible for North Corel winding up like this!
<speaker name="Man">Man</speaker><boxstart/>Get out of the way!!<boxstart/>The only way we can make ends meet around here now is by collecting junk!
<stage>Inside a tent...</stage>
<speaker name="Old Man">Old Man</speaker><boxstart/>The next train's coming in soon.
<speaker name="Black Woman">Black Woman</speaker><boxstart/>Grandpa used to be a Coal Train engineer.<boxstart/>He still can't kick his old habits from then.
<stage>Inside another tent...</stage>
<speaker name="Man">Man</speaker><boxstart/>I want to leave this garbage dump of a town behind me, and start a new life.<boxstart/>If I had a buggy, I'd cross the southern desert, and go to that town across the river...
<speaker name="Woman">Woman</speaker><boxstart/>Everyone knows that accident couldn't have been avoided.<boxstart/>But no one will be satisfied until someone takes the blame.
<speaker name="Kid">Kid</speaker><boxstart/>There was something glowing in that well over there.<boxstart/>If I can get my hands on it, I'm gonna sell it and go to the Gold Saucer!
<speaker name="Tool Shopkeeper">Tool Shopkeeper</speaker><boxstart/>Please buy something! Anything will do!
<speaker name="General Store Shopkeeper">General Store Shopkeeper</speaker><boxstart/>What do you want?
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>- Buy<boxstart/>- Listen to your story<boxstart/>- Not interested
<speaker name="General Store Shopkeeper">General Store Shopkeeper</speaker> (when asked for a story)<boxstart/>Take that road on the left to the Ropeway station!<boxstart/>The Ropeway'll take you to the Gold Saucer.<boxstart/>It don't mean much to us poor folks though...
<speaker name="Weapon Shopkeeper">Weapon Shopkeeper</speaker><boxstart/>If you want to survive, then you're gonna need some of my weapons.
<stage>In the house made of scrap...</stage>
<speaker name="Man">Man</speaker><boxstart/>How am I supposed to continue living in a town that's lost everything...?<boxstart/>To hell with the Mako reactor!
<speaker name="Woman">Woman</speaker><boxstart/>Because of them...... ugh. My husband got into that accident... He used to be such a strong man...
<speaker name="Little Girl">Little Girl</speaker><boxstart/>Yaaay!! What do you wanna play?
<stage>Back outside...</stage>
<speaker name="Man in Hardhat">Man in Hardhat</speaker><boxstart/>I hear it's a big fad now in the city to get tattoos. Is that right?
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>- I wouldn't know<boxstart/>- That's right

  <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>I wouldn't know
  <speaker name="Man in Hardhat">Man in Hardhat</speaker><boxstart/>Really...? I saw a big '1' on the arm of a young guy heading towards the Ropeway. That Black Cape he had on was really cool.


  <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>That's right
  <speaker name="Man in Hardhat">Man in Hardhat</speaker><boxstart/>I guess I should get a '0' tattoo! For a poor man like me, '0' oughtta be perfect.

<stage>Cloud the others continue to the ropeway station.</stage>
<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>Barret, what happened?
<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Sorry.
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>What happened?
<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>My hometown used to be around here.
<speaker name="Red XIII">Red XIII</speaker><boxstart/>What do you mean 'used to'?
<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>It ain't here no more. Heard it got buried... in just 4 years.
<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>But how could those people say those terrible things?
<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>An' it's my fault. ALL my fault.
<stage>Flashback to the town of Corel. A Shinra soldier stands guard outside the Mayor's house as townspeople hurry inside.</stage>
<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker> (narrating)<boxstart/>...My hometown, Corel's always been a coal mining town.<boxstart/>It's so dusty, but calm and so poor...... a real small town, this one.<boxstart/>That's the first time I ever heard the word "Mako Reactor" mentioned since that time...
<stage>Inside the house, a group of men are gathered. Scarlet and two Shinra employees stand before them.</stage>
<speaker name="Village Headman">Village Headman</speaker><boxstart/>What are we going to do? The only one against this is Dyne...
<stage>Dyne stands up.</stage>
<speaker name="Dyne">Dyne</speaker><boxstart/>I am definitely against it, no matter what. There's nothing to talk about if you're thinking of throwing away our coal!<boxstart/>Our coal's been protected for generations. Our fathers, and theirs before them, risked their lives for it.<boxstart/>We have no right to throw it all away so easily!
<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>But listen, Dyne. No one uses coal nowadays. It's the sign of the times.
<speaker name="Scarlet">Scarlet</speaker><boxstart/>Right, everything is Mako, now.<boxstart/>It'll be all right, Dyne. Shinra, Inc. will guarantee your livelihood once the Mako Reactor is completed.
<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Listen, Dyne. I don't want my wife, Myrna, to suffer anymore.
<speaker name="Dyne">Dyne</speaker><boxstart/>I know how you feel! I feel the same way too, damn it!<boxstart/>But even so, I won't give away our coal mines!
<speaker name="Village Headman">Village Headman</speaker><boxstart/>Dyne... you've got to understand.
<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker> (narrating)<boxstart/>That's how the Corel Reactor was built..... and completed.<boxstart/>We all thought it would bring us an easier life.
<stage>The scene changes to show Corel in flames.</stage>
<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker> (narrating)<boxstart/>It happened when Dyne and I were out of town for a few days.<boxstart/>Corel was burned down by the Shinra troops.<boxstart/>All the townspeople... All my relatives...... Everyone... everything......
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Shinra troops? What for!?
<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>There was an explosion at a reactor.<boxstart/>Shinra blamed the accident on the people. Said it was done by a rebel faction.
<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>That's so terrible!
<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Well, I guess that's true. But more than Shinra, I couldn't forgive myself.<boxstart/>Never should've gone along with the building of the reactor...
<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>Don't blame yourself. We were all fooled by the promises Shinra made back then.
<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>That's why... that's why I get so pissed off!!<boxstart/>Not only did they take advantage of me...... But I lost my wife, Myrna, too...
<speaker name="Station Man">Station Man</speaker><boxstart/>Hey everyone! If you want to go to the 'Gold Saucer', hurry and get on!<boxstart/>Ride the Ropeway?
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>- Go on<boxstart/>- Don't go on

  <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>Go on
  <speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Let's get on.
  He gets on the ropeway.
  <speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Dyne was my best friend. We was close ever since we was kids...
  He follows Cloud.
  <speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>I never knew. Barret never said a thing...
  <speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>.........
  <speaker name="Red XIII">Red XIII</speaker><boxstart/>.........
  <speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>I'm not sympathizing with Barret! He never should have trusted Shinra, Inc. ...
  She gets on, and the others watch her.
  <speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>.........<boxstart/>We better go on!
  <stage>She, Aerith, and Red XIII get on, and the ropeway leaves the station.</stage>
 

  <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>Don't go on
  <speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Dyne was my best friend. We was close ever since we was kids...
  <speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>I'm waiting inside.
  She gets on the ropeway.
  <speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>I never knew. Barret never said a thing...
  <speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>Everything Shinra does seem to make everyone miserable...
  <speaker name="Red XIII">Red XIII</speaker><boxstart/>.........
  <speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>It's all my fault...
  <speaker name="Station Man">Station Man</speaker><boxstart/>The Ropeway takes you to the 'Gold Saucer'. It's free, so don't worry about it.

  <stage>They eventually get on the ropeway and it leaves the station.</stage>
