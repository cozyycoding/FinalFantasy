Leaving Gold Saucer

<stage>Cloud and the others pass through North Corel on their way to Gold Saucer.</stage>
<speaker name="Man">Man</speaker><boxstart/>A buncha guys called Turks came here sayin' they'd pay 10000 gil for some rock called a 'Keystone'.<boxstart/>When I asked how much they'd pay for a regular rock just layin' around here, they slapped me upside my damn head!!
<speaker name="Man 2">Man 2</speaker><boxstart/>I'll never understand the rich. I heard some guy named Dio at the Gold Saucer is collectin' rocks!
<stage>They take the Ropeway up to Gold Saucer.</stage>
<speaker name="Fortune Telling Machine">Fortune Telling Machine</speaker> (at Wonder Square)<boxstart/>What you are looking for is near.
<stage>Cloud and the others make their way to Battle Square, which has by now reopened.</stage>
<speaker name="Man">Man</speaker><boxstart/>I heard that this is the curator's favorite attraction. He likes it so much that he even has his collection displayed in the arena.
<speaker name="Woman">Woman</speaker><boxstart/>Are you here for the battle, too?
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>- That's the idea<boxstart/>- Not interested

  <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>That's the idea
  <speaker name="Woman">Woman</speaker><boxstart/>I like fighters. But hate those who're all talk.


  <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>Not interested
  <speaker name="Woman">Woman</speaker><boxstart/>Is that so.

<stage>Cloud continues on up the steps.</stage>
<speaker name="Black-haired Man">Black-haired Man</speaker><boxstart/>Crap! I still don't have enough points.<boxstart/>Mmm? You're new here, aren't you? Then, you want an explanation of the Battle Arena?
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>- Yeah<boxstart/>- Not interested
<speaker name="Black-haired Man">Black-haired Man</speaker><boxstart/>You fight here and collect battle points. You can then exchange those points for prizes.<boxstart/>The Battle Game... even though it's a game you still use all your physical abilities. To participate, go to the front and pay yer GP's.<boxstart/>You can fight in up to eight battles. The more you win, the more battle points you get.<boxstart/>But, if you lose, you lose all your points. So it's up to you whether or not to fight after each win.<boxstart/>They also make it harder by givin' out handicaps.<boxstart/>They decide what handicaps there'll be, and you won't know what you're up against until the battle.<boxstart/>Oh yeah, once you leave the Battle area, all your battle points will become useless. So watch it.<boxstart/>Oh, and one other thing. The maximum points you could get is 65000, no more. So if you get that many you should exchange them for something.
<speaker name="Large Man">Large Man</speaker><boxstart/>Maybe I could've made it a little further. It's so hard to know when to stop...<boxstart/>Man, I knew I should've stopped. But it's so hard to stop...
<speaker name="Man Practicing Kicks">Man Practicing Kicks</speaker><boxstart/>I'm not going to lose this time!<boxstart/>All right, it should be my turn comin' up here soon.
<speaker name="Registration Lady">Registration Lady</speaker><boxstart/>Hey, have you heard? Something awful happened!<boxstart/>Two staff members and some Shinra soldiers were shot.<boxstart/>The soldiers died instantly, but the staff survived.
<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Dyne......
<speaker name="Registration Lady">Registration Lady</speaker><boxstart/>Register for battle? The registration fee is 10 GP.
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>- Let's do it<boxstart/>- Not interested
<speaker name="Staff Person">Staff Person</speaker><boxstart/>Whenever you come to the Gold Saucer, I recommend you visit the owner's museum at least once.
<stage>Cloud enters Dio's Show Room. Various items rest on pedestals around the room, with plaques labeling them.</stage>
<speaker name="Item Plaques">Item Plaques</speaker><boxstart/>"Star Cup"<boxstart/>"Weekend Clock"<boxstart/>"Laugh Sapling"<boxstart/>"Slayer's Pot"<boxstart/>"Chisa's Mask"<boxstart/>"Dio's Portrait"<boxstart/>"D Type Equipment"<boxstart/>"Zauger's Cup"<boxstart/>"Calling Gourd"
<stage>In the center display is the Keystone.</stage>
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>It's the Keystone...
<stage>Dio enters from behind him.</stage>
<speaker name="Dio">Dio</speaker><boxstart/>Heh, heh, heh. Long time no see, my boy. Hmm? You like that, huh?
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Can you let me borrow this?
<speaker name="Dio">Dio</speaker><boxstart/>Heh, heh, heh. Sorry, but it's not for rent.<boxstart/>Hmm.<boxstart/>Since you've been good to me in the past, I CAN let you have it on one condition.
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>One condition?
<speaker name="Dio">Dio</speaker><boxstart/>Heh, heh, heh. Entertain me!
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>- What'd you want me to do?<boxstart/>- Not in the mood

  <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>What'd you want me to do?
  <speaker name="Dio">Dio</speaker><boxstart/>Hoo boy!<boxstart/>Heh, heh, heh. It's not something that's really difficult.<boxstart/>This is the Battle Arena. Show me your fighting skills. Just you, my boy. I'm expecting a good fight!


  <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>Not in the mood
  <speaker name="Dio">Dio</speaker><boxstart/>I see... Then let's pretend that this never happened.

<stage>When Cloud takes him up on the deal, he enters the Battle Arena.</stage>

  <stage><speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>If he completes all 8 battles...</stage>
  <speaker name="Dio">Dio</speaker><boxstart/>Heh, heh, heh! Well done, young man! All right, as I promised,<boxstart/>you can take it. Oh, and I'll give you this too.
  Received "Protect Vest"
  Received "Choco Feather"!


  <stage><speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>If he does fairly well...</stage>
  <speaker name="Dio">Dio</speaker><boxstart/>Hmm, you did pretty well, young man!<boxstart/>Good, it's a promise, so go ahead and take it. I'll give this to you too.
  Received "Protect Vest"


  <stage><speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>If he does poorly...</stage>
  <speaker name="Dio">Dio</speaker><boxstart/>That's the best you could do? Well, a promise is a promise. Go ahead, take it.

Received Key Item "Keystone"!
<speaker name="Dio">Dio</speaker><boxstart/>Well then, we shall meet again! Heh, heh, heh.
<stage>When trying to leave Gold Saucer with the keystone, Cloud is intercepted by a staff member.</stage>
<speaker name="Staff">Staff</speaker><boxstart/>Excuse me, sir.<boxstart/>I'm sorry. The Tram is out of order right now.
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>...so?
<speaker name="Staff">Staff</speaker><boxstart/>I'm really sorry!<boxstart/>I'm afraid you won't be able to leave until it's fully repaired.
<stage>If Cait Sith is not in the party, he bounces up to join Cloud now.</stage>
<speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>What's wrong?
<stage>Cloud explains.</stage>
<speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>Too bad. It happens, though.<boxstart/>I know! Let's stay at the hotel! They know me here. I'll go talk to them.
<speaker name="Staff">Staff</speaker><boxstart/>I will let you know once the repairs are completed.
<stage>At the hotel, the entire team gathers in the lobby.</stage>
<speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>We don't usually get the chance to be together like this, huh?<boxstart/>Cloud, how 'bout it? Can you tell us what's happened so far?<boxstart/>I don't really know what's goin' on because I wasn't here in the beginning.
<speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>Yeah! I'm all for it!
<speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>Good idea.
<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>I been here since the beginnin', an' I still don't know what the hell's goin' on either.<boxstart/>Cloud, the hell's goin' on? C'mon, tell us!
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>- I'm tired...<boxstart/>- All right, I'll give it a shot...

  <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>I'm tired...
  <speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>All we have to do now is sleep! You're still young! What're you complaining about?


  <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>All right, I'll give it a shot...
  <stage>Nothing special happens.</stage>

<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Phew...<boxstart/>We are going after Sephiroth.<boxstart/>Sephiroth must be in search of the Promised Land.
<speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>The Promised Land?
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>A land full of Mako energy. ...or at least that's what the Shinra believe.<boxstart/>I don't know if it actually exists.
<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>The Cetras return to the Promised Land. A land that promises boundless happiness.
<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Cetra? That some kinda disease?
<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>That's what the Ancients call themselves.<boxstart/>Hey, didn't you listen to the elders at Cosmo Canyon?
<stage>Barret scratches his head.</stage>
<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>...You don't 'know' where the Promised Land of the Ancients is.<boxstart/>You search and travel, until you feel it. Like you just know, '...this is the Promised Land.'
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Aerith... can you feel it too?
<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>I think so.
<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>So Sephiroth is traveling the world because he's searching for the Promised Land? Is that it?
<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>That, and one other thing he's searching for.
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>The Black Materia...
<speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>I heard from Dio that a man in a Black Cape was lookin' for the Black Materia.
<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>I don't even know what the Black Cape is...<boxstart/>How many men with Black Capes and number tattoos are there?
<speaker name="Nanaki">Nanaki</speaker><boxstart/>...you know, of course... My tattoo is number 13.
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>How did you get that tattoo?
<speaker name="Nanaki">Nanaki</speaker><boxstart/>...Hojo put it on me. Everything else is just war scars, but the number was done by Hojo.
<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>So there are at least 13!?
<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>...You know......<boxstart/>I think Hojo did something to those men in the Black Capes.<boxstart/>But I don't know what it has to do with Sephiroth though...<boxstart/>That's why I think we should just go after Sephiroth himself.
<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Yeah, me too! It's all just too damn confusin'.
<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>And...<boxstart/>I'm sorry, forget it!<boxstart/>I think I'm tired. I'm going to bed now.
She runs upstairs.
<speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>What was that, all of a sudden!?
<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>What!? That's it? I'm goin' to bed!
She runs off after Aerith.
<speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>Is that all? How 'bout the Black Materia?
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>You wouldn't understand even if I told you.
<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Now all we gotta do is take action! We're startin' tomorrow!!
He runs upstairs.
<speaker name="Nanaki">Nanaki</speaker><boxstart/>Cloud...<boxstart/>I'm number 13. Am I going to go mad too?
<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>I don't know what Hojo did to you, but you've been all right so far, right?
<speaker name="Nanaki">Nanaki</speaker><boxstart/>But...
<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>Be strong.
<speaker name="Nanaki">Nanaki</speaker><boxstart/>But, I...
<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>Stop it, Nanaki! Be strong!
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Tifa?
<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>You're not the only one who's worried!
<speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>I don't know what's goin' on, but we're in a bad situation...
<speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>Hey Cid, let's go back to our rooms.
<speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>...zzzz... zzzz...
<stage>Cloud retires to his room. There comes a knock on the door.</stage>
[Aerith enters.]<boxstart/>[Tifa enters.]<boxstart/>[Yuffie enters.]<boxstart/>[Barret enters.]

<stage>Aerith enters Cloud's room.</stage>
<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>Hee, hee!
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>What's wrong?
<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>You want to go on a date?
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>What?
<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>A DA-TE! Or haven't you ever gone on one?
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>- Don't take me for a fool<boxstart/>- Well, not a real one...

  <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>Don't take me for a fool
  <speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>Hey...a little touchy, aren't we?


  <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>Well, not a real one...
  <speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>No, just a mixed-up kid...

<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>Oh well, come on let's go...
She runs around behind him and starts pushing him out of the room.
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Hey!

<speaker name="Bystanders">Bystanders</speaker><boxstart/>What?
<stage>Cait Sith runs past Cloud and down the steps of Chocobo Square, where Tseng arrives in a helicopter.</stage>
<speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>Hey! Over here! The Keystone!
He throws Tseng the Keystone.
<speaker name="Tseng">Tseng</speaker><boxstart/>Well done.
<stage>The helicopter flies off as Cloud and his date catch up to Cait Sith.</stage>
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Hey!
<speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>W, wait a second. I won't run or hide.<boxstart/>Yes, I was a spy. I was hired by the Shinra.

	<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>...I trusted you. I can't believe you!
	<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>Don't mess with us!
	<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>You think I'm jokin'!?
	<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Ya dirty &amp;*$*%$!

<speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>I couldn't help it.<boxstart/>How 'bout if we continue like nothing ever happened?
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>No way, cat! You gotta lot of guts acting like a friend but being a spy!
<speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>Then, what are you goin' to do? Kill me?<boxstart/>You'd just be wastin' your time if you tried. This body's just a toy anyway.<boxstart/>My real body's at Shinra Headquarters in Midgar. I'm controlin' this toy cat from there.

	<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>So you're from Shinra. Who? Who are you! Tell me!
	<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>So you're from Shinra. Who are you?
	<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Part of the Shinra! Who the *&amp;$# are you!?
	<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>The hell are ya!? What's your real name!?

<speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>Whoa, I can't tell you my name.
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>We're not gettin' anywhere.
<speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>See? I told you! Talking won't do any good, so can't we just continue our journey?
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>You think I'm jokin'!?
<speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>...Alright, yes, I am a Shinra employee.<boxstart/>But we're not entirely enemies.<boxstart/>...Something bothers me. I think it's your way of life.<boxstart/>You don't get paid. You don't get praised. Yet, you still risk your lives and continue on your journey. Seeing that makes me...<boxstart/>It just makes me think about my life. I don't think I'd feel too good if things ended the way they are now.

	<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>......And so on, and so on...
	<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>You're lying again.
	<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Sounds fishy---
	<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Hmph! You ain't foolin' us this time!

<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>He'll never tell the truth. Once a spy, always a spy.<boxstart/>We can't go on with someone like that. C'mon get real!!
<speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>...just as I thought. Talking won't make a bit of difference.<boxstart/>But I prepared something in case this happened.<boxstart/>Why don't you listen to this?
<speaker name="Marlene">Marlene</speaker><boxstart/>Papa! Tifa!

	<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>...Marlene?
	<speaker name="Marlene">Marlene</speaker><boxstart/>Hey! It's Cloud!


	<stage><speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>If Barret is Cloud's date...</stage>
	<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Ma......Marlene!?
	<speaker name="Marlene">Marlene</speaker><boxstart/>Hey! It's Dad! Dad! It's me, Marlene!

<speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>...So, you have to do as I say.
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>...you're the lowest...
<speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>I didn't want to do this... using dirty tricks and taking hostages...<boxstart/>But this is how it is... no compromises. So why don't we continue on as we did?

	<stage><speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>If Cloud has learned what the Keystone is for...</stage>
	<speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>Tomorrow is the Temple of the Ancients, right? I know where it is so I'll tell you later.<boxstart/>Of course, we'll get there after the Shinra, but you'll have to deal with that.


	<stage><speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>If Cloud hasn't learned about the Keystone...</stage>
	<speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>Oh, you didn't seem to know this, but...<boxstart/>The Keystone is the key to the Temple of the Ancients. Even so, you're all going, right?<boxstart/>I know where it is, so I'll show you later.<boxstart/>The Shinra have already been there, but I guess you have to deal with that.

<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>...Well, we're stuck... We'll have to do what he says.

	<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>I wonder if Marlene is all right... I wonder what happened to Mom.
	<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>......Marlene.
	<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Uh, yup.
	<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Sorry, Cloud.


<stage>Cloud and the others spend the night at Gold Saucer. In the morning, they again gather in the lobby. Cloud is the last to arrive.</stage>
<speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>What took you so long, Cloud?<boxstart/>Oh yeah, about the Temple of the Ancients. I think if we take the Tiny Bronco East towards the sea, we should be able to find it.<boxstart/>Well then, shall we get goin'? Who's gonna go?
<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>I want to go! I'm going for sure!
<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Yo! I'm goin' too, Cloud! Gotta keep movin'!!
<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>You know...... no, forget it. Let's go.
<speaker name="Nanaki">Nanaki</speaker><boxstart/>I'm so excited, my tail's starting to tingle. Let's go, Cloud!
<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>I'm startin' to get nervous.
<speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>The Temple of the Ancients is to the east. Shall we go?
<speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>The Temple of the Ancients... This might be pretty interesting...
<speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>I don't care what's goin' on let's just go!
<stage>Cloud and his chosen party head for the door.</stage>
<speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>Then see you later.
<speaker name="Fortune Telling Machine">Fortune Telling Machine</speaker> (at Wonder Square)<boxstart/>What you search for is in the Southeast
