The Road to Junon - Yuffie

Chocobo Farm on the Grasslands
Mythril Mine: A Run In with the Turks
Forests of Junon: Meeting Yuffie

<stage>Travelling across the grasslands from Kalm, Cloud and the others come across a chocobo farm. In a pen outside, several chocobos are walking about.</stage>
<speaker name="Chocobo">Chocobo</speaker><boxstart/>Wark!<boxstart/>Wark? Warkwark wark?
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>- Wark<boxstart/>- Warrrk

  <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>Wark
  <stage>The chocobos perform a sort of waltz.</stage>
  <speaker name="Chocobo">Chocobo</speaker><boxstart/>Wark-----
  Received "Choco/Mog" Materia!


  <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>Warrrk
  <speaker name="Chocobo">Chocobo</speaker><boxstart/>Wark!! Wark!!

<stage>They go inside the house, where they find the owner of the farm.</stage>
<speaker name="Choco Bill">Choco Bill</speaker><boxstart/>Thinking of crossing the marshes?
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>- Yeah<boxstart/>- Not interested

  <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>Yeah
  <speaker name="Choco Bill">Choco Bill</speaker><boxstart/>Hmm, then it'll probably be safer for you to get a Chocobo.<boxstart/>That way you can zip through the marshes with the Chocobo.<boxstart/>It's the only way to avoid being attacked by the Midgar Zolom.<boxstart/>Midgar Zolom...?<boxstart/>It's a serpent-like creature over 30 feet tall!!<boxstart/>It picks up on footsteps that enter the marshes...<boxstart/>And then, BAM!! It attacks!!!<boxstart/>To avoid that, buy a Chocobo at the Choco Bill &amp; Choco Billy Chocobo Farm.<boxstart/>To purchase a Chocobo, please talk to my grandson. He's in the Chocobo stables at the far right end of the farm.<boxstart/>By the way, there was another person heading towards the Marshes.<boxstart/>Without a Chocobo, the Midgar Zolom probably got him. It was a man in a Black Cape.


  <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>Not interested
  <speaker name="Choco Bill">Choco Bill</speaker><boxstart/>Hmm, then, I guess that's that.

<stage>Cloud goes to the stables, where two children are tending to the chocobos.</stage>
<speaker name="Chole">Chole</speaker><boxstart/>Welcome.
<speaker name="Choco Billy">Choco Billy</speaker><boxstart/>Do you want a Chocobo?
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Mmm......<boxstart/>- Give me one<boxstart/>- Nope

  <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>Give me one
  <speaker name="Choco Billy">Choco Billy</speaker><boxstart/>You old folks are out of luck!
  <speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Old folks...?
  <speaker name="Billy">Billy</speaker><boxstart/>We're all out of Chocobos. I'm taking care of those ones out there for someone else.<boxstart/>You know, if you really want a Chocobo, you should go out and catch one.<boxstart/>Want to know how to catch a Chocobo?
  <speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>- Where are they?<boxstart/>- How do I catch one?<boxstart/>- What else?<boxstart/>- Not interested
  
    <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>Where are they?
    <speaker name="Choco Billy">Choco Billy</speaker><boxstart/>You see those claw prints out there? Wild Chocobo's will appear in those areas.<boxstart/>But, if you don't have 'Chocobo Lure' they won't come out. They very cautious animals by nature.
    <speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>- Chocobo Lure?<boxstart/>- Go on
    
      <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>Chocobo Lure?
      <speaker name="Choco Billy">Choco Billy</speaker><boxstart/>'Chocobo Lure' is a type of materia which attracts Chocobos.<boxstart/>If you equip this, they'll come to you. But, without it, they won't appear.
    
    
      <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>Go on
      <stage>Back to the tutorial menu; Cloud can ask any of his initial questions again.</stage>
    
  
  
    <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>How do I catch one?
    <speaker name="Choco Billy">Choco Billy</speaker><boxstart/>A wild Chocobo always appears with other monsters.<boxstart/>But, you won't be able to catch it because of the monsters.<boxstart/>That is why you must defeat the monsters first before you catch the Chocobo.
    <speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>- And then?<boxstart/>- That all you can talk about?
    
      <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>And then?
      <speaker name="Choco Billy">Choco Billy</speaker><boxstart/>Also, wild Chocobos are really cautious. They'll run away from the slightest things.<boxstart/>But, if you use 'Greens' They'll focus on that, and won't run away.
    
    
      <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>That all you can talk about?
      <stage>Back to the tutorial menu; Cloud can ask any of his initial questions again.</stage>
    
  
  
    <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>What else?
    <speaker name="Choco Billy">Choco Billy</speaker><boxstart/>Whatever you do, don't make Chocobos angry. They're usually calm, but if you get them angry, you'll get hurt.<boxstart/>Oh, and remember, once you get off a Chocobo, it'll escape.
  
  
    <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>Not interested
    <speaker name="Choco Billy">Choco Billy</speaker><boxstart/>Well then, shall we get down to business?<boxstart/>I'll sell you the 'Chocobo Lure' for 2000 gil, right now.<boxstart/>You want it?
    <speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>- Buy it<boxstart/>- Don't buy it
    
      <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>Buy it
      <speaker name="Choco Billy">Choco Billy</speaker><boxstart/>Thanks!<boxstart/>It wouldn't hurt to buy some 'Greens' either.<boxstart/>Oh, and how fast a Chocobo'll finish eating depends of what type of 'Greens' you feed them.
    
    
      <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>Don't buy it
      <speaker name="Choco Billy">Choco Billy</speaker><boxstart/>Mmmm, if you don't have it, you'll never catch one.
    
  


  <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>Nope
  <speaker name="Choco Billy">Choco Billy</speaker><boxstart/>Oh, I'm so glad!

<speaker name="Chole">Chole</speaker><boxstart/>Wasn't it really expensive?<boxstart/>But don't be mad at my brother or Grandpa.<boxstart/>Ever since dad and mom died, it's been like this...
<stage>After leaving the farm, Cloud catches a chocobo and they cross the marshes, avoiding the Midgar Zolom. On reaching the other side, they find the giant snake impaled on a dead tree and stop to stare.</stage>
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Did Sephiroth... do this......?

	<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>This Sephiroth guy's pretty strong, I'd say.
	<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>Our enemy is someone that could do this...?
	<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>Amazing...
	<speaker name="Red XIII">Red XIII</speaker><boxstart/>It's a power that we should respect...

<stage>Moving on past this display of power, they enter the Mythril Mines. After navigating through the tunnels, they come across an open cave, where they run into Rude of the Turks.</stage>
<speaker name="Rude">Rude</speaker><boxstart/>Just a second!

	<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Wh, who are you!?
	<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>By any chance, are you...?
	<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>Who are you?
	<speaker name="Red XIII">Red XIII</speaker><boxstart/>...... I hoped I'd never see you again...

<speaker name="Rude">Rude</speaker><boxstart/>Do you know who I am?
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>- From the Turks, right?<boxstart/>- Not interested

  <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>From the Turks, right?
  <speaker name="Rude">Rude</speaker><boxstart/>Well if you know, then this won't take long.


  <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>Not interested
  <speaker name="Rude">Rude</speaker><boxstart/>......I'm from the Turks. And don't you ever forget it.

<speaker name="Rude">Rude</speaker><boxstart/>It's difficult to explain what the Turks do...
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Kidnapping, right?
<speaker name="Rude">Rude</speaker><boxstart/>To put it negatively... you could say that.<boxstart/>...But, that's not all there is to it, anymore.<boxstart/>............<boxstart/>............
<speaker name="Elena">Elena</speaker><boxstart/>Sir!<boxstart/>It's all right, Rude! I know you don't like speeches, so don't force it!
<speaker name="Rude">Rude</speaker><boxstart/>...Then Elena, explain.
<speaker name="Elena">Elena</speaker><boxstart/>I'm the newest member of the Turks, Elena. Thanks to what you did to Reno, we're short of people.<boxstart/>...Although, because of that, I got promoted to the Turks, ...<boxstart/>In any case, our job is to find out where Sephiroth is headed.<boxstart/>And to try and stop you every step of the way.<boxstart/>Wait a minute, it's the other way around... You're the ones that are getting in our way.
<speaker name="Tseng">Tseng</speaker><boxstart/>...Elena. You talk too much.
<speaker name="Elena">Elena</speaker><boxstart/>Mr. Tseng!?
<speaker name="Tseng">Tseng</speaker><boxstart/>No need to tell them about our orders.
<speaker name="Elena">Elena</speaker><boxstart/>Sorry... Tseng.
<speaker name="Tseng">Tseng</speaker><boxstart/>I thought I gave you other orders.<boxstart/>Now go. Don't forget to file your report.
<speaker name="Elena">Elena</speaker><boxstart/>Oh! Right!<boxstart/>Very well, Rude and I will go after Sephiroth, who's heading for Junon Harbor!
<speaker name="Tseng">Tseng</speaker><boxstart/>...Elena. You don't seem to understand.
<speaker name="Elena">Elena</speaker><boxstart/>Oh! I'm, I'm sorry...
<speaker name="Tseng">Tseng</speaker><boxstart/>...Go. Don't let Sephiroth get away.
<speaker name="Rude &amp; Elena">Rude &amp; Elena</speaker><boxstart/>Yes sir!
<stage>They make their way for the exits. Rude turns back.</stage>
<speaker name="Rude">Rude</speaker><boxstart/>...Reno said he wanted to see you after the injuries you gave him healed.<boxstart/>He wants to show his affection for you all... with a new weapon.
Rude leaves.
<speaker name="Tseng">Tseng</speaker><boxstart/>Well, then...

  <stage><speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>If Aerith is in the party...</stage>
  <speaker name="Tseng">Tseng</speaker><boxstart/>Aerith... Long time no see.<boxstart/>Looks like you got away from the Shinra for a while, now that Sephiroth reappeared.
  <speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>...so what are you saying? That I should be grateful to Sephiroth?
  <speaker name="Tseng">Tseng</speaker><boxstart/>No...<boxstart/>Well, I won't be seeing too much of you, so take care.
  <speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>...strange, hearing that from you.
  <speaker name="Tseng">Tseng</speaker><boxstart/>Well then, stay out of Shinra's way.


  <stage><speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>If Aerith is not in the party...</stage>
  <speaker name="Tseng">Tseng</speaker><boxstart/>...Where's Aerith? She's not with you?
  <speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Aerith isn't with us. She's with the others.
  <speaker name="Tseng">Tseng</speaker><boxstart/>Oh... Then give her my regards.

<stage>Tseng leaves, and Cloud and the others continue out of the mines.</stage>

<stage>Passing through the forests on the way to Junon, they run into a "mystery ninja," who attacks them. After being defeated, she lies on the ground with the party standing around her. There's a save point nearby.<boxstart/><boxstart/>
* <speaker name="Note">Note</speaker>: Because you can pick up Yuffie at almost any time in the game, I've included every character's reaction here.</stage>

	<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Wassup with that broad?
	<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>Who is that girl...?
	<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>Cloud, do you know her?
	<speaker name="Red XIII">Red XIII</speaker><boxstart/>...You don't see ones like that everyday...<boxstart/>Who is that girl? She's still a child.
	<speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>Who do you think it is? I didn't recognize the face.
	<speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>She has a mysterious weapon... I've seen her somewhere before...
	<speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>Who is that kid!


  <stage><speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>Cloud walks to the save point.</stage>
  <stage>After exiting the Menu screen, they find that the ninja has disappeared.</stage>
  <speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Haa----ah! Gotcha! And you deserve it, too!

	  <speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>The Gil doesn't seem to be her real objective...
	  <speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>Steal MY money, will ya? You got a lot of #&amp;^%$ nerve!!<boxstart/>Just remember who you're dealin' with, punk!!
  


  <stage><speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>Cloud walks over to Yuffie.</stage>
  <stage>Yuffie sits up.</stage>
  <speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Man...... I can't believe I lost...
  <stage>She jumps up.</stage>
  <speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>You spikey-headed jerk! One more time, let's go one more time!
  Or, if Tifa is party leader:
  Hey, boobs! Try that again! Just one more time!
  Or, if Cid is party leader:
  Hey, you bow-legged ol' man! Give me another chance! I'll fight ya again!
  <speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>- All right<boxstart/>- Not interested
             <speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>- What did you say!?<boxstart/>- Don't fight

    <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>All right
    <speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>I won't lose this time! Take your time and get ready. Holler when you're ready!
    She shakes her fist at Cloud.<boxstart/><boxstart/>At this point, it's not possible to talk to her again, so you have to check the Menu screen. Afterwards, they find that Yuffie has disappeared.
    <speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>No way I'm going to fight with punks like you more than once!<boxstart/>I'll keep enough for the doctor bill! Next time, you won't be as lucky!
