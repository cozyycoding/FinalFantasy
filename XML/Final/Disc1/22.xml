<stage>Cloud and the others land the Tiny Bronco on the shores of Wutai and start making their way north. On a hilltop, Yuffie runs ahead and stands in their way.</stage>
<stage>* <speaker name="Note">Note</speaker>: Because this is an optional sidequest, it is also possible to do it when either Tifa or Cid are the party leader, so their responses are included along with Cloud's.</stage>
<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Wait, wait, wait, wai----t!!

	<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>What!? The hell happened, all of a sudden!?

<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>I know this area pretty well.<boxstart/>It gets pretty tough past here. Better get ready...

	<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>...You serious? And you sayin' that just now means you're up to somethin'! Right!?<boxstart/>That means, I don't trust you.
	<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>......Hmmm... Something's fishy...<boxstart/>You're not planning something sneaky again, are you?
	<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>...Really? Something's telling me I still shouldn't trust you.<boxstart/>Are you thinking of tricking us again...?
	<speaker name="Nanaki">Nanaki</speaker><boxstart/>Hmm, ... Smells fishy.<boxstart/>My nose never lies!
	<speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>You serious? I can't trust a person like you.<boxstart/>But, I guess I'm not one to talk.
	<speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>Further down? I don't see any signs of danger...<boxstart/>Also, there's something unnatural in the way Yuffie's acting...
	<speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>Hey! You, serious?<boxstart/>If you're trying to con us, you won't get away with it!

<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>No! It's REALLY tough...
<speaker name="Soldiers">Soldiers</speaker><boxstart/>There they are, catch 'em!!
<stage>Shinra soldiers run in.</stage>

	<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>The Shinra!!
	<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>Hey, the Shinra......!?
	<speaker name="Nanaki">Nanaki</speaker><boxstart/>It's Shinra!!

	<speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>Not bad, Yuffie, not bad at all.
	<speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>So what does this mean... You will explain this later...
	<speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>Yuffie! You sure got some nerve, kid!

<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>I didn't know! I have nothing to do with this one!

	<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Whaddya mean 'this one'!? 'This one'!<boxstart/>So you WERE plannin' somethin'!!
	<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>This one? What do you mean 'THIS one'?<boxstart/>So you WERE up to something bad!
	<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>This one? Did you just say 'THIS one'?<boxstart/>So you WERE trying to pull something off!
	<speaker name="Nanaki">Nanaki</speaker><boxstart/>What do you mean 'this one' 'THIS one'!<boxstart/>So you were concocting some evil scheme!!
	<speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>This one? What do you mean 'THIS one'?<boxstart/>So you had something else that you're planning to trick us with!
	<speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>What do you mean, 'This one'?<boxstart/>You had something else in mind?
	<speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>Whaddya mean 'THIS one'! 'THIS one'!<boxstart/>So you WERE planning some crooked $%*&amp;!!

<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>No, umm, uh......
<speaker name="Shinra Soldiers">Shinra Soldiers</speaker><boxstart/>What should we do!?<boxstart/>Uh...... Get them! Grab them and ask questions later!!
<stage>The soldiers run to attack Cloud and the others, and Yuffie runs off in the confusion.</stage>

	<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>The hell's goin' on!?<boxstart/>I knew somethin' was missing. All my materia's gone!!
	<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>What's going on!?<boxstart/>I thought something was missing... my materia's all gone!!
	<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>What's going on!?<boxstart/>I thought something was fishy... My, my materia is missing!!
	<speaker name="Nanaki">Nanaki</speaker><boxstart/>What's going on?<boxstart/>I thought something was funny, my materia, disappeared!!
	<speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>What's going on!?<boxstart/>Something's missing, and it's my materia-it's all gone!!
	<speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>I thought something was wrong, So that's it.<boxstart/>Look, my materia's been stolen...
	<speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>What the hell's goin' on!<boxstart/>I knew I was missing something... My materia's gone!!


	<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Yo... where's that $#@^% Yuffie...?
	<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>Hey... where's Yuffie...?
	<speaker name="Nanaki">Nanaki</speaker><boxstart/>Hey... where's Yuffie...?
	<speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>Now... where's Yuffie...?
	<speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>Ey... where the hell's that damn kid...?

<stage>They all look around.</stage>

	<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>That &amp;*&amp;$ kid!!!<boxstart/>Grrrrrgh!! Arrrrrgh Uhhhhhhhhhhhh!!<boxstart/>She was after our materia from the start!!<boxstart/>She went North! When I get my hand on her, I'll get our materia back!<boxstart/>C'mon! We're goin' after her!
	<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>I'm so------ mad!!<boxstart/>She was probably eyeing our materia from the beginning.<boxstart/>Seems like she headed North. Let's hurry after her and get our materia back!
	<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>She's done it to us again!!<boxstart/>I'm never gonna forgive her!<boxstart/>She was after our materia from the beginning.<boxstart/>I won't let her get away with it! I'm pretty sure she ran off North. Let's go after her!!
	<speaker name="Nanaki">Nanaki</speaker><boxstart/>ZOUNDS!!<boxstart/>Grrrrrrrrrgh...... Grrrgh! Grrrrrrgh!!<boxstart/>Her objective was stealing our materia from the beginning.<boxstart/>...sniff... North! She ran off to the North!<boxstart/>I'm not going to let her get away with this! Hurry, hurry! We have to get our materia back!
	<speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>She's done it again!<boxstart/>She sure took us for fools!<boxstart/>She must've been after our materia from the beginning.<boxstart/>We can't just let her get away, right? Then, let's hurry after her! Which way? It's North, the North! It's a message from the stars!
	<speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>Inexcusable...<boxstart/>Seems as though all that she was after was our materia.<boxstart/>We can't just let her get away. She ran off...... to the North...<boxstart/>We must go after her and retrieve our materia back.
	<speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>That little ^%#^$@!!<boxstart/>Takin' me for a fool!!<boxstart/>No doubt about it! That kid was after my materia from the start!!<boxstart/>Hmm... Seems like she went North.<boxstart/>Don't be draggin' your asses! We're going right NOW! That $#@^ is history!!

<stage>If Cloud tries to get back in the Tiny Bronco to leave...</stage>

	<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>...First, I gotta do something about her.
	<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>I can't just leave it there...
	<speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>Damn kid! I'll get her no matter what!

<stage>They go north and arrive in Wutai, where they immediately spot Yuffie.</stage>
<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Hey!!
She runs off.
<stage>Outside Yuffie's house..</stage>
<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>This is MY house! Nobody gets in!
<speaker name="Man on the Path to Godo's House">Man on the Path to Godo's House</speaker><boxstart/>Lord Godo is in this house.<boxstart/>He used to be quite strong, but now, all he does is sleep......<boxstart/>What, Yuffie... It's best to ask Lord Godo about that.<boxstart/>But today he's not in the best of... Well, I should say... But really he's not so......
<stage>In the Weapons shop...</stage>
<speaker name="Weapons Shopkeeper">Weapons Shopkeeper</speaker><boxstart/>Sorry, listen I... No, nothing... never mind.
<speaker name="Man">Man</speaker><boxstart/>Sorry, but we're entirely sold out now.<boxstart/>What's this here? Ah, no... that's uh...<boxstart/>...a sample! Yeah, that's it... a sample. Sorry, but why don't you all come back later?
<stage>The local pub, Turtle's Paradise... Outside is a flyer.</stage>
<speaker name="Pub [Turtle's Paradise] Publicity Flyers! Notice">Pub [Turtle's Paradise] Publicity Flyers! Notice</speaker><boxstart/>[Turtle's Paradise] is now having a Publicity flyer campaign.<boxstart/>They will be posted all over the world. So make sure you look for our flyers that say "Turtle's Paradise"<boxstart/>There's six in all. If you find them all, make sure to let the owner of Turtle's Paradise know.

<speaker name="Barkeeper">Barkeeper</speaker><boxstart/>Hey, hey, welcome! You on a trip? Well, just relax and make yourself at home.<boxstart/>Nowadays, thanks to tourism, Wutai's able to get by.
<speaker name="Man">Man</speaker><boxstart/>Hey. Did you hear? There used to be a Water God here in Wutai.<boxstart/>They say the Water God was a huge snake!<boxstart/>Now we live in a world filled with Mako. Not many people would believe in something like that now.<boxstart/>But some in the world, and here in Wutai, still believe.<boxstart/>Believe in the scales of the Water God and in materia that has its power in it.
<stage>Cloud walks up to the Turks - Reno, Rude, and Elena - who are drinking at a table.</stage>
<speaker name="Elena">Elena</speaker><boxstart/>Yy, you!? How did you get here...?
She jumps up.
<boxstart/>Never mind that. I guess it's fate that brought us together.<boxstart/>Get ready to die!!
<stage>Cloud and the others ready their weapons. Reno and Rude don't move.</stage>
<speaker name="Reno">Reno</speaker><boxstart/>...Elena, you talk too much.
<speaker name="Elena">Elena</speaker><boxstart/>Ww, what?
<speaker name="Reno">Reno</speaker><boxstart/>What are we doing way out here in the middle of nowhere?
<speaker name="Elena">Elena</speaker><boxstart/>We're taking our vacation and resting up from our work.
<speaker name="Reno">Reno</speaker><boxstart/>Now our vacation is ruined.
<speaker name="Elena">Elena</speaker><boxstart/>B, but...
<speaker name="Rude">Rude</speaker><boxstart/>...even the booze tastes bad now.
<speaker name="Elena">Elena</speaker><boxstart/>...sorry...
<stage>She sits back down, and Cloud relaxes.</stage>
<speaker name="Elena">Elena</speaker><boxstart/>Hmm, you're lucky all right. Now get out of my sight!<boxstart/>The next time we meet I won't be so nice.
<speaker name="Reno">Reno</speaker><boxstart/>Drink, Rude! How long have we been a team...?<boxstart/>There have been hard times being a Turk, but all in all, I'm glad I did it.<boxstart/>I even got to meet a bunch of wing nuts like you.
<speaker name="Rude">Rude</speaker><boxstart/>To the Turks... To Reno... cheers!
<stage>Outside the Item Shop, a little kid is running around.</stage>
<speaker name="Little Kid">Little Kid</speaker><boxstart/>Alright, alright, alright! I know!<boxstart/>On the side of the mountain, right there in your face is Da-chao!<boxstart/>I hear you can climb to the top, but since it's dangerous I'd be mighty careful if I were you!<boxstart/>A girl with materia? No, there hasn't been anyone climbing Da-chao for some time now.<boxstart/>You know I've noticed that there's  pounding noise from time to time in this store.
<speaker name="Man on the Path to Godo's House">Man on the Path to Godo's House</speaker><boxstart/>Lord Godo is in this house.<boxstart/>He used to be quite strong, but now, all he does is sleep......<boxstart/>Anyhow, for some reason Yuffie's had a fondness for materia ever since I can remember.<boxstart/>She's always hung around places she thought might have it.
<stage>In the Item Shop...</stage>
<speaker name="Item Shopkeeper">Item Shopkeeper</speaker><boxstart/>We got a lot of different stuff here. Take what you want.
<speaker name="Woman">Woman</speaker><boxstart/>I'm sorry. The sign outside says "Materia", but there's almost no materia left anywhere in Wutai.<boxstart/>Listen, this is just a backwoods town. We don't have much to do with Shinra, and besides...<boxstart/>If we had a lot of materia, Wutai would be a much more exciting town, but we don't...
<stage>Cloud opens the nearby treasure chest.</stage>
Received "MP Absorb" Materia!
<stage>Yuffie jumps down from above.</stage>
Stole "MP Absorb" Materia!
<speaker name="Woman">Woman</speaker><boxstart/>Huh? What? You DID?
<stage>Cloud continues up the path towards Godo's house.</stage>
<speaker name="Man outside Godo's House">Man outside Godo's House</speaker><boxstart/>That five-storied pagoda over there is called the Pagoda of the Five Mighty Gods...<boxstart/>The Five Gods are Power, Speed, Magic, War and Omni, who has the best characteristics of everything.<boxstart/>Since ancient times, we in Wutai, have worshipped Da-chao and the Water God.<boxstart/>Legend has it that the village has been protected by Da-chao, the Water God, and the Five Mighty Gods.<boxstart/>But in the last battle, we didn't fare so well... I guess our beliefs were based on nothing more than legends.
<stage>Inside the pagoda...</stage>
<speaker name="Gorky">Gorky</speaker><boxstart/>...
<stage>If Cloud tries to run upstairs...</stage>
<speaker name="Gorky">Gorky</speaker><boxstart/>Freeze!<boxstart/>You aren't from Wutai, are you?
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>- No<boxstart/>- Yes

  <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>No
  <speaker name="Gorky">Gorky</speaker><boxstart/>Only those from Wutai are allowed in the tower!<boxstart/>I'll have to ask for you to leave!


  <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>Yes
  <speaker name="Gorky">Gorky</speaker><boxstart/>Hey! I hate people who lie about their identities! Leave this tower at once!

<stage>Inside Godo's house, they find Godo lying on a futon.</stage>
<speaker name="Godo">Godo</speaker><boxstart/>GOOGAH... what do you want?<boxstart/>Don't have... GAH... anything much but, you should be able to... GOO... rest yourselves here. GOGAH... make yourselves at home.<boxstart/>......Yuffie? ......nope, never heard of her. ...GOOGO...<boxstart/>...you again? I told you once, and I'm telling you again, I don't know her.
He sits up.
<boxstart/>Listen, I said I didn't know her! There isn't anyone named Yuffie here in Wutai!
He gets to his feet and turns to face Cloud.
<boxstart/>...never seen you around here before...<boxstart/>Lately I've been seeing a lot of Shinra soldiers around here... You wouldn't have anything to do with that would you?<boxstart/>I don't care about who you are.<boxstart/>But if you're in trouble with the Shinra, I'm going to have to ask you to leave.<boxstart/>I don't want the Shinra hanging around here looking over my shoulder.
<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>What's with you, you coward!
She jumps down from the ceiling to stand in his doorway.
<speaker name="Godo">Godo</speaker><boxstart/>Yuffie......!
<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>You scared of the Shinra?<boxstart/>Then why don't you fall into line and obey them, just like all of the other towns!
She runs into the room.
<boxstart/>Those guys are the ones who are really fighting the Shinra!
<speaker name="Godo">Godo</speaker><boxstart/>Shut up! What would you know about this?
<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>You get beaten once, and then that's it?<boxstart/>What happened to the mighty Wutai I used to know?
<speaker name="Godo">Godo</speaker><boxstart/>No kid like you's going to talk to me like that!<boxstart/>You keep acting like that! You ought to be ashamed of yourself!
<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>That's my style! And it's my own business, not yours! Don't you try and dictate what I should do!
<speaker name="Godo">Godo</speaker><boxstart/>Style...? Dictate...?<boxstart/>Throwin' around all those fancy words... You're a miserable daughter!
<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Hmph! You're a sad excuse for a father!!
<stage>She runs out and into the shrine down the hall. Godo starts to chase after her, but gives up and returns to his room.</stage>
<speaker name="Godo">Godo</speaker><boxstart/>......take your things and get out of here now.<boxstart/>To protect Wutai, we cannot afford to stand up to Shinra.
<speaker name="Man on the Path to Godo's House">Man on the Path to Godo's House</speaker><boxstart/>She's always getting into fights. But in that, she takes after Godo to a tee.<boxstart/>Like father like daughter...<boxstart/>Yuffie's like that, you know. Sometimes she'll just bust into people's houses.<boxstart/>Then she hides in the shadows... Just like a little kid.
<speaker name="Woman Walking near River">Woman Walking near River</speaker><boxstart/>Life is just like the flowing of a river. It flows from the large ocean of life, and eventually it returns back to it.<boxstart/>Wutai is a historical place. There are some very unusual things here you should see.<boxstart/>Yuffie? I saw her a while ago. She must be in one of the houses around here.
<stage>At the old man's house...</stage>
<speaker name="Boy">Boy</speaker><boxstart/>Oh no! More weirdos<boxstart/>No, these aren't like the one from a while ago, but these ones look weird too!
<speaker name="Old Man">Old Man</speaker><boxstart/>Well, well. Long time no see. What have you been up to? Let's see... what was your name?
<speaker name="Boy">Boy</speaker><boxstart/>No, Gramps! This isn't anyone you know! This is just some stranger who barged into our house!<boxstart/>What are we going to do, Gramps? Some strange-looking girl came in here a minute ago and I...
<stage>Cloud pushes aside a screen to reveal Yuffie hiding behind it.</stage>
<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>......
She dashes out of the house.
<speaker name="Old Man">Old Man</speaker><boxstart/>Oh, how exciting. You a friend of my grandson's?
<speaker name="Boy">Boy</speaker><boxstart/>No, Gramps! These guy's are creepy! They're runnin' all over the place!
<speaker name="Man on the Path to Godo's House">Man on the Path to Godo's House</speaker><boxstart/>She's always getting into fights. But in that, she takes after Godo to a tee.<boxstart/>Like father like daughter...<boxstart/>That reminds me, Lately I've been seeing a kid around here that reminds me of Yuffie.<boxstart/>Always sneakin' around corners And into somethin' she shouldn't be.
<stage>If Cloud tries to leave Wutai...</stage>

	<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Wait, that damn Yuffie's still gotta be somewhere in this cheap town! Or you all jes' gonna go on?
	<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>I don't think she came out from here... Is that ok?
	<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>Knowing Yuffie, she's still hidden somewhere in town. You sure?
	<speaker name="Nanaki">Nanaki</speaker><boxstart/>I know she hasn't left town! You still want to leave?
	<speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>She couldn't have left town... I think she is must still be here... Or do you want to go on?
	<speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>You lettin' that damn kid off the hook? I know she's gotta be in this town somewhere!

<stage>Outside the Turtle's Paradise, there is a barrel that's jiggling. Cloud and the others position themselves near the escape routes and then open it. Yuffie jumps out and tries to get away, but finds herself surrounded.</stage>

	<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>You can't get away, Yuffie.
	<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>Give it up, Yuffie!
	<speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>You lost, Yuffie.

<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>O... ok, I know... I was wrong......<boxstart/>You win. I'll give you back your materia...
<stage>She leads them to her house, just as two soldiers run into Turtle's Paradise.</stage>

<speaker name="Shinra Soldier">Shinra Soldier</speaker><boxstart/>So our reports were right! He IS here on vacation!<boxstart/>We've finally found him! Get the Turks here for back-up!
<speaker name="Reno">Reno</speaker><boxstart/>...what a drag.
<speaker name="Shinra Soldier">Shinra Soldier</speaker><boxstart/>Wh, what was that...?
<speaker name="Reno">Reno</speaker><boxstart/>Right now we're off duty and can't run off to save your butts.
<speaker name="Shinra Soldier">Shinra Soldier</speaker><boxstart/>We know you're off duty, but...
<speaker name="Reno">Reno</speaker><boxstart/>If you knew that, then don't bother us! Lookin' at you is makin' me sober.
<speaker name="Shinra Soldier">Shinra Soldier</speaker><boxstart/>But you all have orders from headquarters to look for him too!
<stage>There is a pause. Reno says nothing.</stage>
<speaker name="Shinra Soldier">Shinra Soldier</speaker><boxstart/>All right, that's it! We'll get him without any help from the Turks, just you see!
<stage>The two soldiers run out. One comes back momentarily.</stage>
<speaker name="Shinra Soldier">Shinra Soldier</speaker><boxstart/>And don't think that headquarters isn't going to hear about this!!
He leaves again.
<speaker name="Elena">Elena</speaker><boxstart/>Reno, do you think that was really such a good idea!?<boxstart/>I mean is that the way a professional, a Turk would act!?
<speaker name="Reno">Reno</speaker><boxstart/>Elena. Don't misunderstand.<boxstart/>A pro isn't someone who sacrifices himself for his job. That's just a fool.
<speaker name="Elena">Elena</speaker><boxstart/>Rude...?
<speaker name="Rude">Rude</speaker><boxstart/>.........
<speaker name="Elena">Elena</speaker><boxstart/>Well, I don't buy that! Goodbye!!
She runs out.
<speaker name="Rude">Rude</speaker><boxstart/>.........
<speaker name="Reno">Reno</speaker><boxstart/>Relax. She's not a child. Let her have her way now...

<stage>At Yuffie's house...</stage>
<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>I know, the materia, right? I have it stored in a safe place. ...Follow me.
She leads them down to the basement, a training room.
<speaker name="Flyer on Wall">Flyer on Wall</speaker><boxstart/>[Turtle's Paradise] No. 6<boxstart/>Drink at the "Turtle's Paradise" And talk about Wutai!<boxstart/>You'll know "Turtle's Paradise" by the big pot outside!!
<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker>...I've been hearing that ever since I was little. Before I was born, Wutai was a lot more crowded and more important...<boxstart/>You saw what it looks like now, right? ...JUST a resort town...<boxstart/>After we lost the war, we got peace, but with that, we lost something else. Now look at Wutai...<boxstart/>That's why... if I had lots of materia I could...
She starts crying.

	<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Listen, Yuffie. I don't care about the history of Wutai or your feelings.<boxstart/>You've got our materia and I want it back... now.<boxstart/>If you give it back now, we'll drop the whole thing.
	<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>I'm sorry, Yuffie. I know how you feel, but we need materia too.<boxstart/>...We just can't let you have it. Please understand.
	<speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>......Dammit, Yuffie. We ain't got time to be listening to your life story.<boxstart/>If you want materia, get it yourself. That's how you should do it.

<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>I know. I know that...<boxstart/>That... sniff... switch... the lever on the left...... materia's... sniff, hic... in there.
<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Ain't nuthin' we can do about it...

<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>Now, the Materia...
<speaker name="Nanaki">Nanaki</speaker><boxstart/>Were we a little too harsh on her?
<speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>Well, let's get our materia back.
<speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>There was nothing else to do.
<speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>Hmmph... I dunno......
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>- Flip the Left Lever<boxstart/>- Flip the Right Lever
<stage>Regardless of which lever he pulls, a cage comes down atop the party members.</stage>

And when you're looking for the materia, remember you gotta steel it.<boxstart/>He heh... steel... steel! Get it?<boxstart/>C ya!!
<stage>She runs off. If Cloud tries to run after her without helping the others...</stage>

	<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Y, yo, wait up!!
	<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>Wait, don't leave us!

	<speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>Wait, don't go by yourself!
	<speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>Hey! Help me first!


<stage>Cloud frees the others from the cage and they go looking for her.<boxstart/><boxstart/>At the Turtle's Paradise...</stage>
<speaker name="Barkeeper">Barkeeper</speaker><boxstart/>Seems like the town got really boisterous since you arrived. Did anything happen?
<speaker name="Reno">Reno</speaker><boxstart/>......It's just that we're off duty!<boxstart/>I don't feel like drinking with you. And don't talk to me.
<speaker name="Rude">Rude</speaker><boxstart/>.........
<stage>Cloud goes to the bell near Godo's house to find the gate open. When he rings the bell, a hidden door opens. Going inside, he finds Yuffie being abducted by a man in black.</stage>
<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Let go! I SAID let GO!<boxstart/>Hey! Who do you think I...... OW! What're you doin'...? Jerk!

	<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>You......!
	<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>Oh! You're......!
	<speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>Ww, who are you!?

<speaker name="Corneo">Corneo</speaker><boxstart/>......ho..... ...............ho.........<boxstart/>Hohi, hohi! Hohihi!

	<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Corneo!?
	<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>Don Corneo!?
	<speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>The hell are you doing!

<speaker name="Corneo">Corneo</speaker><boxstart/>Hohi!<boxstart/>I've finally got a new chicky!<boxstart/>Two for one, in fact! Hohi, hohi!
<speaker name="Cloud, Tifa, or Cid">Cloud, Tifa, or Cid</speaker><boxstart/>Two!?
<speaker name="Elena">Elena</speaker><boxstart/>H......hey! Let go of me! You're gonna regret this!!
<speaker name="Corneo">Corneo</speaker><boxstart/>Hohi, hohi! Hohihi!
<stage>Corneo and his lackeys run off, and Cloud follows them into the shrine. Three Shinra soldiers cut Corneo off.</stage>
<speaker name="Shinra Soldier">Shinra Soldier</speaker><boxstart/>There he is! It's Corneo! Don't let him get away!<boxstart/>Attaaaack!
<stage>Corneo runs to the side, and the soldiers attack Cloud and the others instead. Back outside Godo's house, they find Reno and Rude.</stage>
<speaker name="Reno">Reno</speaker><boxstart/>Hmm... that Corneo is good at escaping...
<speaker name="Rude">Rude</speaker><boxstart/>......Elena.
<speaker name="Reno">Reno</speaker><boxstart/>Let's go, Rude. We'll give them a taste of what the Turks can do.
<stage>Rude nods and runs off.</stage>
<speaker name="Reno">Reno</speaker><boxstart/>......Sounded pretty good.
He turns to Cloud.
<boxstart/>If Elena is in his hands, that's going to make things a little difficult.<boxstart/>And uh...

	<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>......Ok. Corneo took Yuffie from us.<boxstart/>And without Yuffie, there's no way we'll get our materia back.
	<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>......all right. Corneo stole Yuffie from us, as well.<boxstart/>And without her, there's no way we'll get our materia back.
	<speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>......that's just beautiful! And now that *#$^@'s walked off with Yuffie, too!<boxstart/>And without that brat, we can't get our hands on our materia!

<speaker name="Reno">Reno</speaker><boxstart/>Don't misunderstand.<boxstart/>We have no intention of joining you. But for now, we'll agree not to bother each other. That's all.

	<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>That's fine. We have absolutely no intention of cooperating with the Turks either.<boxstart/>Now, uh, just what direction did Corneo run off to?
	<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>The same goes for us. We don't want to be friendly with the Turks.<boxstart/>Now which direction did Corneo run off in?
	<speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>Of course! There ain't no way we'd wanna join up with the Turks anyway!<boxstart/>Anyhow, which direction did that %^$*&amp; run off in?

<speaker name="Reno">Reno</speaker><boxstart/>Hmm, nice attitude. Here's a clue, it's the place that stands out the most.
Reno runs off.
<speaker name="Man on the Path to Godo's House">Man on the Path to Godo's House</speaker><boxstart/>Two girls just went off towards Da-chao. I wonder if that place is starting to become popular with the kids?<boxstart/>One had herself all tangled up in a rope. And the other one kind of looked like Yuffie.
<speaker name="Little Kid">Little Kid</speaker><boxstart/>Alright, alright, alright! I saw an old man in flashy clothes running towards Da-chao!<boxstart/>He was babblin' somethin' and looked like he could float! It almost bowled me over!
<stage>Cloud arrives at Da-chao.</stage>
<speaker name="Reno">Reno</speaker><boxstart/>You're finally here. We're gonna split into two.<boxstart/>You do whatever you want. But don't endanger Elena.<boxstart/>Don't worry. We won't do anything to that girl, Yuffie.<boxstart/>For now...
<stage>Following Reno up the mountain...</stage>
<speaker name="Reno">Reno</speaker><boxstart/>Don't fool around. You know the enemy's not gonna wait for us, right?
<stage>Following Rude...</stage>
<speaker name="Rude">Rude</speaker><boxstart/>......
<stage>In the end they find Corneo holding Yuffie and Elena tied to the face of a statue, observing them from the palm of the statue's hand.</stage>
<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>LET... ME...... GO!!!!
<speaker name="Corneo">Corneo</speaker><boxstart/>Hmm! Delicious... scrumptious! I think I've just found a new HOBBY!<boxstart/>Which shall it be? Hmm... Hmm...<boxstart/>Should I go... with HER?
<speaker name="Elena">Elena</speaker><boxstart/>He... hey, I'm one of the 'Turks'! Don't think you can get away with this!?
<speaker name="Corneo">Corneo</speaker><boxstart/>Or... maybe... HER?
<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Oh GAWD! If I knew this was gonna happen, I would've taken rope escape lessons more seriously!!
<speaker name="Corneo">Corneo</speaker><boxstart/>Hmm!!! I've made my choice! My companion for the night will be......<boxstart/>...the cheerful one!
<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>GROSS-NESS!<boxstart/>Don't mess with me old man! You don't even have any Materia!
<speaker name="Corneo">Corneo</speaker><boxstart/>Oooooh! And she's saucy, too! Wheee! Wheee!

	<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>All right, that's it!!
	<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>Hold it right there!
	<speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>Hey, hey, hey! That's as far as you go!

<speaker name="Corneo">Corneo</speaker><boxstart/>Hee-haw. What... what's goin' on!? Who's there?
<stage>Cloud and the others run in.</stage>
<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Oh man! Cloud......!
Or, if Tifa:
<boxstart/>Oh man! Tifa......!
Or, if Cid:
<boxstart/>Oh man! That old fart, Cid......!
<speaker name="Corneo">Corneo</speaker><boxstart/>Wheeel... long time no see.
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Don't tell me you forgot...

	<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>You damn Midgar hyena...!
	<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>You just don't get it, do you...!?
	<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>That fall into the trap really hurt!
	<speaker name="Nanaki">Nanaki</speaker><boxstart/>Hurry and let the two go!
	<speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>Listen you stupid, slimy, sleazy old scab bag! If you want to get women, there's such a thing as the RIGHT way!
	<speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>I don't care what you're doing, so much as the idiotic way you're doing it...
	<speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>Maybe God'd forgive an ugly ^#@# like you, but I won't!

<speaker name="Corneo">Corneo</speaker><boxstart/>Be quiet! None of you know how much I've suffered since then...<boxstart/>It's a long story, but......

	<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>I don't really care! Let Yuffie and Elena go!
	<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>We don't want to hear it! Just let the two go!
	<speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>I don't really give a damn! You're gonna let the two girls go, or else I'm gonna break your arm!

<speaker name="Corneo">Corneo</speaker><boxstart/>Hmm... You guys are... serious. ......Good, good.<boxstart/>...this ain't no time for me to be fooling around either...<boxstart/>Why did you kill my little Aps?<boxstart/>I'm gonna make you PLAY with my new pet, so you won't get in the way of my search for a bride!<boxstart/>RAPPS---come here!!
<stage>Cloud and the others fight and defeat Rapps.</stage>
<speaker name="Corneo">Corneo</speaker><boxstart/>Wait...<boxstart/>Just wait a second!

	<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>SHUT UP!
	<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>You better say your prayers!
	<speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>Don't be such a poor loser, old man!

<speaker name="Corneo">Corneo</speaker><boxstart/>Just listen to me - it won't take long.<boxstart/>Why do you think a bad guy like me would swallow his pride and plead for his life?
<speaker name="Cloud, Tifa, or Cid">Cloud, Tifa, or Cid</speaker><boxstart/>- 1 Because he's ready to die<boxstart/>- 2 Because he's sure to win<boxstart/>- 3 Because he's clueless

  <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>1 Because he's ready to die
  <speaker name="Corneo">Corneo</speaker><boxstart/>Hmm...! WRONG...!


  <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>2 Because he's sure to win
  <speaker name="Corneo">Corneo</speaker><boxstart/>Hmm...! RIGHT!


  <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>3 Because he's clueless
  <speaker name="Corneo">Corneo</speaker><boxstart/>Hmm...! Close, but no cigar...!

<stage>Corneo pushes a button and Elena and Yuffie flip upside down.</stage>
<speaker name="Elena">Elena</speaker><boxstart/>Eyaaaah...!
<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Makes me so MAD...!
<speaker name="Corneo">Corneo</speaker><boxstart/>If I push this button, they'll fall upside down, and we'll have a SQUASHED TOMATOES!
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Damn...!

	<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Damn dirty-playin' $#%@&amp;T$*^%$!
	<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>All right...
	<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>Coward!
	<speaker name="Nanaki">Nanaki</speaker><boxstart/>Grrrrrgh...!
	<speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>You sure are vulgar!
	<speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>......!
	<speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>So this is how a loser lives...!

<speaker name="Corneo">Corneo</speaker><boxstart/>Now, give me your women too!<boxstart/>Ha, ha, ha, ha! I guess I'm the one laughing last!
<speaker name="Reno">Reno</speaker><boxstart/>No, that would be us.
<speaker name="Corneo">Corneo</speaker><boxstart/>Hee-haw. What... what's goin' on!? Who's there?
<stage>Enter Reno.</stage>
<speaker name="Corneo">Corneo</speaker><boxstart/>...The Turks!
<speaker name="Reno">Reno</speaker><boxstart/>You knew this was gonna happen ever since you leaked that secret.<boxstart/>We're going to take care of you... personally.
<speaker name="Corneo">Corneo</speaker><boxstart/>DAMMIT! Then they're all goin' with me!
<stage>Rude runs in from behind and throws something at Corneo, who falls to the edge of the hand.</stage>
<speaker name="Corneo">Corneo</speaker><boxstart/>Ugh...!
<speaker name="Reno">Reno</speaker><boxstart/>Good timing, Rude.
<speaker name="Rude">Rude</speaker><boxstart/>...Let's get to work.
<stage>Reno walks over to Corneo and steps on his fingers.</stage>
<speaker name="Reno">Reno</speaker><boxstart/>All right, Corneo. This'll be over quick, so listen up.<boxstart/>Why do you think we went to all the trouble of teaming up with those guys to get you...?<boxstart/>1. Because we were ready to die<boxstart/>2. Because we were sure of victory<boxstart/>3. Because we were clueless
<speaker name="Corneo">Corneo</speaker><boxstart/>Two... Number two?
<speaker name="Reno">Reno</speaker><boxstart/>All wrong.
He grinds his foot into Corneo's hand.
<speaker name="Corneo">Corneo</speaker><boxstart/>No...! Wait, sto......!
He loses his grip and falls.
<boxstart/>Aaaaaaaaaa......p
<speaker name="Reno">Reno</speaker><boxstart/>The correct answer was...
<speaker name="Rude">Rude</speaker><boxstart/>...because it's our job.
<speaker name="Elena">Elena</speaker><boxstart/>Oh, thank you very much...!<boxstart/>I never expected you'd to come help......
<speaker name="Reno">Reno</speaker><boxstart/>Elena, don't act so weak.<boxstart/>You're a Turks!
<speaker name="Elena">Elena</speaker><boxstart/>Y... Yes, sir!

	<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Never thought you'd come an' help us...
	<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>Thanks for your help.
	<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>Th... Thanks.
	<speaker name="Nanaki">Nanaki</speaker><boxstart/>I'll just say you... helped.
	<speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>You guys have some good in you.
	<speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>It would appear thanks are in order...
	<speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>I guess, thanks for today.

<speaker name="Rude">Rude</speaker><boxstart/>......
<stage>Reno's cell phone rings, and he answers it.</stage>
<speaker name="Reno">Reno</speaker><boxstart/>Yes... this is Reno.<boxstart/>Yes... Yes... I'll get on it right away.
<speaker name="Elena">Elena</speaker><boxstart/>Was that the company?
<speaker name="Reno">Reno</speaker><boxstart/>Yeah, they want us to find Cloud...
<stage>Cloud and the others ready their weapons.</stage>
<speaker name="Rude">Rude</speaker><boxstart/>Are we on...?
<speaker name="Reno">Reno</speaker><boxstart/>No, today we're off duty.
<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Hey---who cares about that!? Get----me-----down----!
<stage>Back at Yuffie's house. She darts around putting the materia back in its slots.</stage>
<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Phew, perfect. Now the materia is back in its rightful place.

	<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Hey... the placement of it is all messed up.
	<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>Hey, what is this...? The placement of it's all messed up!
	<speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>What the hell's goin' on!? The placement of the materia's all messed up!

<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Huh? Oh, it'll be all right...<boxstart/>Don't be so picky!<boxstart/>Anyways, that sure was close......<boxstart/>No, normally I would kick their butts, Boom, Bang!!
She shakes her fist and turns away.
<boxstart/>That Corneo guy's a real pain.
<stage>Behind her back, Cloud and the others exchange looks.</stage>
<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>I'd rather deal with my dad than deal with that guy.
<stage>Cloud and the others walk out.</stage>
<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Oh, by the way, some of those guys from the Turks are good, huh?<boxstart/>At least, after all that, we got the materia back.<boxstart/>Now come on everybody, let's continue our journey...
She turns around to notice they've gone.
<boxstart/>......Hey!! W...... Wait!<boxstart/>Oh, all right. Here, I'll give this to you guys.
She runs into her room to grab something and comes back out.
<boxstart/>Here, look, look!
Received "MP Absorb" Materia!
<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>.........<boxstart/>Come on, wait---!
She runs out after them.
<boxstart/>No matter what anyone says, I'm going with you!<boxstart/>...next time......

<stage>After everything has died down, they can go back to Wutai so Yuffie can climb the pagoda.</stage>
<speaker name="Woman Walking near River">Woman Walking near River</speaker><boxstart/>Materia is like Life. They both come from the large ocean of life, and both must return to it.
<stage>In the Weapons Shop...</stage>
<speaker name="Man">Man</speaker><boxstart/>Listen, I'm sorry about last time. Yuffie told me not to sell anything to you.
<speaker name="Weapons Shopkeeper">Weapons Shopkeeper</speaker><boxstart/>Hey yo! Welcome!<boxstart/>Strike while the iron's hot, I say! We got some of the best blades right out of the furnace!
<speaker name="Little Kid">Little Kid</speaker><boxstart/>Alright, alright, alright! I know!<boxstart/>On the side of the mountain, right there in your face is Da-chao!<boxstart/>I hear you can climb to the top, but since it's dangerous I'd be mighty careful if I were you!<boxstart/>Why Da-chao? Alright, alright, alright! I don't know!
<stage>Cloud and the others enter the pagoda.</stage>
<stage>If Yuffie is in the party and they try to proceed to the second floor without fighting...</stage>
<speaker name="Gorky">Gorky</speaker><boxstart/>Freeze!<boxstart/>Miss Yuffie! You cannot go on to the second floor until you defeat me!
<speaker name="Gorky">Gorky</speaker><boxstart/>Oh, Miss Yuffie! Will you be climbing the pagoda today?
<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>- Yeah, that's it<boxstart/>- No way!
<speaker name="Gorky">Gorky</speaker><boxstart/>Then I, Sacred Gorky, will be your opponent on the first floor!
<stage>A boy runs down from upstairs.</stage>
<speaker name="Shake">Shake</speaker><boxstart/>Yo! They call me Shake! I'll be watchin' your fight with Gorky!
<speaker name="Gorky">Gorky</speaker><boxstart/>Then, begin!<boxstart/>Power Change!
<stage>Yuffie fights Gorky.</stage>

  <stage><speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>If she loses...</stage>
  <speaker name="Gorky">Gorky</speaker><boxstart/>It's just my opinion, but you need more training! Gorky is disappointed!
  <speaker name="Shake">Shake</speaker><boxstart/>No good! You have to do Gorky! Are you mocking this Pagoda?
  <speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Shut up! Shut up! SHADDUP!


  <stage><speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>If she wins...</stage>
  <speaker name="Gorky">Gorky</speaker><boxstart/>Here I am, Miss Yuffie!
  <speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Of course!
  <speaker name="Shake">Shake</speaker><boxstart/>Hmm, I thought you were just a wild girl, but you handled that pretty well!<boxstart/>Well, we'll see how you do on next one...

<stage>Shake goes upstairs, and Yuffie follows.</stage>
<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Who's next?
<speaker name="Shake">Shake</speaker><boxstart/>Are you blind? I'm right here!
<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>What? I gotta fight a punk?
<speaker name="Shake">Shake</speaker><boxstart/>Heh! Punk. I'm more of an adult than some bimbo girl!
<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Wh, what did you say!?
<speaker name="Shake">Shake</speaker><boxstart/>See what I mean? That kind of anger's what makes you so immature!<boxstart/>Don't pat yourself on the back until you beat me!
<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Now watch...!
<speaker name="Shake">Shake</speaker><boxstart/>'bout the only thing you do really good is breathe! Sure you're brave enough to fight!
<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>- Stop yappin'!<boxstart/>- I'll forgive you

  <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>Stop yappin'!
  <speaker name="Shake">Shake</speaker><boxstart/>Hm, so someone finally got past Gorky.


  <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>I'll forgive you
  <speaker name="Shake">Shake</speaker><boxstart/>So when it comes down to it, you're just all talk. Brat!

<stage>A woman comes down from upstairs.</stage>
<speaker name="Chekhov">Chekhov</speaker><boxstart/>So, I guess it's time for Chekhov to stand in...
<speaker name="Shake">Shake</speaker><boxstart/>Here I go, brat! Speed Change!
<stage>If Yuffie tries to go to the next floor prematurely...</stage>
<speaker name="Shake">Shake</speaker><boxstart/>Hey, you there! Don't ignore me!
<stage>Yuffie fights Shake.</stage>

  <stage><speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>If she loses...</stage>
  <speaker name="Shake">Shake</speaker><boxstart/>HYAAAAAAH! BRATBRATBRATBRAT!!
  <speaker name="Chekhov">Chekhov</speaker><boxstart/>You can't go to the next floor unless you beat Shake.
  <speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Shut up! Shut up! SHADDUP!


  <stage><speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>If she wins...</stage>
  <speaker name="Shake">Shake</speaker><boxstart/>URRGRAAAAGH! So you CAN fight a bit!
  <speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Of course!
  <speaker name="Chekhov">Chekhov</speaker><boxstart/>Ho, ho, ho... It's been a while since I felt pain...

<stage>Chekhov goes upstairs, and Yuffie follows. A man comes down from the fourth floor.</stage>
<speaker name="Staniv">Staniv</speaker><boxstart/>So even Shake's been defeated. It's been a while since you had to fight, Chekhov.
<speaker name="Chekhov">Chekhov</speaker><boxstart/>Unfortunately, this is as far as it goes. Staniv, you watch over there.
<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>That ain't going to happen! I'll teach you about the strength of youth!
<speaker name="Chekhov">Chekhov</speaker><boxstart/>Keep mouthing off like that, little girl, and you're going to get burned.
<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>- I got insurance<boxstart/>- Let's get this over with, old bag

  <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>I got insurance
  <speaker name="Chekhov">Chekhov</speaker><boxstart/>Ho, ho, ho. We'll see if you still talk like that after you taste some of my Sacred Magic...<boxstart/>Magic Change!


  <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>Let's get this over with, old bag
  <speaker name="Chekhov">Chekhov</speaker><boxstart/>Ho, ho, ho. What do you expect from a child barely out of diapers!?

<speaker name="Staniv">Staniv</speaker><boxstart/>First, Chekhov will keep you company...
<stage>If Yuffie tries to go to the next floor prematurely...</stage>
<speaker name="Chekhov">Chekhov</speaker><boxstart/>How dare they mock us like that, thinking they could sneak past us.
<stage>Yuffie fights Chekhov.</stage>

  <stage><speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>If she loses...</stage>
  <speaker name="Chekhov">Chekhov</speaker><boxstart/>Ho, ho, ho! What does a immature young child know...?
  <speaker name="Staniv">Staniv</speaker><boxstart/>So this IS the average person's limit...
  <speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Shut up! Shut up! SHADDUP!


  <stage><speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>If she wins...</stage>
  <speaker name="Chekhov">Chekhov</speaker><boxstart/>I can't believe you beat me...
  <speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Of course!
  <speaker name="Staniv">Staniv</speaker><boxstart/>This should be interesting...! It's been a long time since I've had a chance to use my powers to their fullest...

<stage>Staniv goes upstairs, and Yuffie follows.</stage>
<speaker name="Staniv">Staniv</speaker><boxstart/>The rule is the best fighter on each floor will be your opponent... Although it's a five-storied pagoda, the fourth floor is the highest...<boxstart/>In other words, no one has ever defeated me--Master of Weaponry!<boxstart/>You still want to try...?
<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>- Just come on!!<boxstart/>- I'll pass!

  <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>Just come on!!
  <speaker name="Staniv">Staniv</speaker><boxstart/>I like you! Now watch...<boxstart/>Weapon Change!


  <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>I'll pass!
  <speaker name="Staniv">Staniv</speaker><boxstart/>You don't seem like the kind of person who can make it to the fourth floor without a problem...

<stage>If Yuffie tries to go to the next floor prematurely...</stage>
<speaker name="Staniv">Staniv</speaker><boxstart/>HAAAAH!
<stage>The door closes.<boxstart/><boxstart/>Yuffie fights Staniv.</stage>

  <stage><speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>If she loses...</stage>
  <speaker name="Staniv">Staniv</speaker><boxstart/>How unfortunate! It was over before I could even put all of my strength into it...
  <speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Shut up! Shut up! SHADDUP!


  <stage><speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>If she wins...</stage>
  <speaker name="Staniv">Staniv</speaker><boxstart/>Wh, what...!?
  <speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Of course!

<stage>The others start coming up from the lower floors.</stage>
<speaker name="Gorky">Gorky</speaker><boxstart/>Splendid! Your level and skills have improved...
<speaker name="Shake">Shake</speaker><boxstart/>Oh, ho! You might not be as much of a child as we thought you were!
<speaker name="Chekhov">Chekhov</speaker><boxstart/>Of course. If WE lost to her...
<speaker name="Staniv">Staniv</speaker><boxstart/>You have defeated four of our best, but now you will have to face HIM......!
<stage>He goes upstairs, and the others follow. Yuffie finds the four of them assembled on the fifth floor, along with Godo.</stage>
<speaker name="Gorky">Gorky</speaker><boxstart/>......
<speaker name="Shake">Shake</speaker><boxstart/>Sh......!
<speaker name="Chekhov">Chekhov</speaker><boxstart/>...
<speaker name="Staniv">Staniv</speaker><boxstart/>......
<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>D, ...Dad!?
<speaker name="Godo">Godo</speaker><boxstart/>I'm glad you made it this far, Yuffie!
<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Why, why are you......
<speaker name="Godo">Godo</speaker><boxstart/>I'll answer you by having you try your skills against me!<boxstart/>Hold nothing back. Come as if you're trying to kill me! If you don't... then I'll have to kill you!
<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>H... hey!
<speaker name="Godo">Godo</speaker><boxstart/>What are you doing! OMNI-Change! ......!!
<stage>Yuffie fights Godo.<boxstart/><boxstart/>If she loses...</stage>
<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Dammit......
<speaker name="Godo">Godo</speaker><boxstart/>Ohhh! And what was that!? Come back when you get more training!
<stage>When Yuffie tries again...</stage>
<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>I'll show you this time, you old Fart-meister!
<speaker name="Godo">Godo</speaker><boxstart/>Hmm? A slight improvement.<boxstart/>Come at me with all you have! OMNI-Change! ......!!
<stage>After winning the battle, both lie sprawled on the floor panting.</stage>
<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>...heave...... heave...
<speaker name="Godo">Godo</speaker><boxstart/>...huff...... puff......
<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>O... old coot... n...... ot... bad...
<speaker name="Godo">Godo</speaker><boxstart/>You've...... also...... improved...
<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Hah... Ha, ha......
<speaker name="Godo">Godo</speaker><boxstart/>...Heh, heh......
<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Ha ha haaaaaa......!
<speaker name="Godo">Godo</speaker><boxstart/>Waha haaaaa......!
<stage>They eventually get up off the floor and compose themselves.</stage>
<speaker name="Godo">Godo</speaker><boxstart/>It's time I gave this to you, Yuffie...<boxstart/>This is Leviathan Materia. Take it.
Received "Leviathan" Materia!
<speaker name="Staniv">Staniv</speaker><boxstart/>But, Lord Godo. The Leviathan Materia should only be given to the person who conquers and takes over this Pagoda. That is our custom...
<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>CUSTOM, CUSTOM, CUSTOM... I'm so sick of hearing that!<boxstart/>It's so stupid!
<speaker name="Gorky">Gorky</speaker><boxstart/>Silence, Miss Yuffie!
<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Then what 'bout the rest of you? You have all that power...<boxstart/>Are you satisfied being cooped up in this tower?
<speaker name="Godo">Godo</speaker><boxstart/>Yuffie...!
<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>You too, dad...! Just because you lost the war!<boxstart/>And turning Wutai into a place like this!
<speaker name="Chekhov">Chekhov</speaker><boxstart/>...What do you want to say?
<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>You turned Wutai into a cheesy resort town peddling to tourists...<boxstart/>How dare you!? Da-chao Statue and Leviathan are ashamed!!
<speaker name="Godo">Godo</speaker><boxstart/>...
<speaker name="Shake">Shake</speaker><boxstart/>She IS a kid.
<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Wh, what did you say...!?
<speaker name="Godo">Godo</speaker><boxstart/>Yuffie!!<boxstart/>Forgive me... It's all my fault...
<speaker name="Gorky">Gorky</speaker><boxstart/>What are you saying, Lord Godo!
<speaker name="Godo">Godo</speaker><boxstart/>Losing the war... turning Wutai into this. It was all my fault...
<speaker name="Chekhov">Chekhov</speaker><boxstart/>Lord Godo!
<speaker name="Godo">Godo</speaker><boxstart/>Silence!!<boxstart/>Yuffie......<boxstart/>I am the same now as I was before when I wanted the war.<boxstart/>But, after I lost the war, I began to think...<boxstart/>Is strength, only for defeating the enemy?<boxstart/>...or just something to show-off to others...?<boxstart/>Might begets might.<boxstart/>That's the same way as the Shinra...
<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>......
<speaker name="Godo">Godo</speaker><boxstart/>I knew you were looking for Materia for the good of Wutai.<boxstart/>But, the reason I hide my strength now, is also for the good of Wutai...<boxstart/>And now, I realize both are necessary...<boxstart/>Strength without determination means nothing. And determination without strength is equally useless...!
<speaker name="Staniv">Staniv</speaker><boxstart/>Lord Godo...
<speaker name="Godo">Godo</speaker><boxstart/>You there, please take Yuffie with you!<boxstart/>I perceive that you all have both determination and strength!

	<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Jes' don't do nothin' funny to our Materia...!
	<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>All right. We'll take your daughter with us.
	<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>...after that, how can we refuse?
	<speaker name="Nanaki">Nanaki</speaker><boxstart/>As long as she doesn't get in our way...!
	<speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>If you put it that way, we can't refuse...
	<speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>Hmm... You may come if you want to...
	<speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>Well, just tell yourself you're on a big ship, and leave the rest to ol' Cid!

<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>All right, I don't mind.
<speaker name="Godo">Godo</speaker><boxstart/>Go, Yuffie!<boxstart/>For the sake of strengthening Wutai!
<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Dad...
<speaker name="Godo">Godo</speaker><boxstart/>I'll take care of the Five Sacred Gods until you return!<boxstart/>Go! And come back alive!
<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>......<boxstart/>Of course!
<stage>Everyone else files out, and Yuffie starts to follow them.</stage>
<speaker name="Godo">Godo</speaker><boxstart/>Yuffie, wait a minute.<boxstart/>The Materia they all have...<boxstart/>After their battle is over, you think they'll still want it?
<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Dad...!
<speaker name="Godo">Godo</speaker><boxstart/>Go! Survive till the end! And return!<boxstart/>With the Materia!
<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Heh, heh... you bet!
She runs off.
<speaker name="Godo">Godo</speaker><boxstart/>Go! Survive to the end! And return to us!<boxstart/>Mat-...<boxstart/>Take care of the Materia!!
<speaker name="Staniv">Staniv</speaker><boxstart/>Miss Yuffie. Your feelings for Wutai are the same as Lord Godo's. Always remember that...
<speaker name="Chekhov">Chekhov</speaker><boxstart/>Fight so that you never bring shame on Wutai.
<speaker name="Shake">Shake</speaker><boxstart/>You say there's some unusual materia where the underground pipe is!?<boxstart/>But, first you gotta get if from a monster and unless you use your head. You won't be able to do it.
<speaker name="Gorky">Gorky</speaker><boxstart/>Miss Yuffie. We pray for your success!
<stage>Cloud and the others leave Wutai and return to their quest.</stage>
