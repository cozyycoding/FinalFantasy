<stage>Aerith and Cloud head through Sector 6 and arrive at the playground.</stage>
<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>The gate to Sector 7's in there.
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Thanks. I guess this is goodbye. You gonna be all right going home?
<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>Oh no! 'What ever will I do!?' ...isn't that what you want me to say?
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>- See her home<boxstart/>- Take her to Sector 7

  <speaker name="Cloud"><boxstart/>See her home</speaker>
  <speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>Isn't that a little out of the way?
  <speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Yeah, I guess so.


  <speaker name="Cloud"><boxstart/>Take her to Sector 7</speaker>
  <speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>I could do that. But won't I be in your way?
  <speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>What do you mean in the way?
  <speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>Nothing!

<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>Can we take a break?
She wanders into the playground and stops by the slide with a cat's face.
<boxstart/>I can't believe it's still here.
She runs around and climbs up on top of it.
<boxstart/>Cloud, over here!
<stage>Cloud shrugs and joins her.</stage>
<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>What rank were you?
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Rank?
<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>You know, in SOLDIER.
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Oh, I was...
Flash.
<boxstart/>First Class.
<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>Just the same as him.
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>The same as who?
<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>My first boyfriend.
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>You were... serious?
<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>No. But I liked him for a while.
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>I probably knew him. What was his name?
<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>It doesn't really matter.
<stage>The gate to Sector 7 opens, and a chocobo-drawn carriage comes out. Tifa is riding in back, wearing a revealing blue dress. Cloud jumps to his feet.</stage>
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Huh? Hey, back there......<boxstart/>Tifa!?
<stage>The carriage pulls past them and into Wall Market.</stage>
<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>That girl in the cart was Tifa? Where was she going? She looked kind of odd...
<stage>Aerith jumps off the slide and runs after the carriage.</stage>
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Wait!<boxstart/>I'll go on alone! You go on home!
<stage>He sighs and follows her into Wall Market.</stage>
<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>This place is scary in a lot of ways. Especially for a girl. So we've got to find Tifa fast.
<speaker name="Man outside Honey Bee Inn">Man outside Honey Bee Inn</speaker><boxstart/>I just can't make up my mind... Mmm.<boxstart/>Huh? About what?<boxstart/>Hmmm, don't make me say it... It's the shop down on the right.

<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>- You know a girl named Tifa?<boxstart/>- This place doesn't interest me.

  <speaker name="Cloud"><boxstart/>You know a girl named Tifa?</speaker>
  <speaker name="Older Man">Older Man</speaker><boxstart/>Hey, you're pretty fast. Tifa's our newest girl.<boxstart/>But, unfortunately, she's having an interview right now.<boxstart/>Here at the Honey Bee Inn, it's customary for all the new girls to be taken to Don Corneo's mansion.<boxstart/>Don Corneo's a famous dilettante. Now he wants to settle down and is in the market for a bride.


  <speaker name="Cloud"><boxstart/>This place doesn't interest me.</speaker>

<stage>Aerith and Cloud step aside to talk.</stage>
<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>Hey, this look's like the Don's mansion. I'll go take a look.<boxstart/>I'll tell Tifa about you.
She starts for the door.
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>No!! You can't!!
<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>Why?
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>You DO know... what kind of... place this is, don't you?
<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>Then what am I supposed to do? You want to go in with me?
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Well being a man, that'll be pretty hard. Besides if I bust in there, it'll cause too much commotion.<boxstart/>But, I just can't let you go in alone... Oh, man......
At this point, Aerith starts laughing, but Cloud continues without noticing.
<boxstart/>First... we need to find out if Tifa's alright...<boxstart/>What's so funny, Aerith?
<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>Cloud, why don't you dress up like a girl? It's the only way.
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>WHAT!?
<stage>Aerith runs over to the doorman before he can protest further.</stage>
<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>Just wait. I've got a cute friend I want to bring.
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Aerith! I can't......
<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>You ARE worried about Tifa, aren't you? Them come on, hurry!
<speaker name="Doorman">Doorman</speaker><boxstart/>A friend, huh...? Sounds pretty good to me.<boxstart/>That'll make the Don happy, too. Who knows, maybe I can...... heeee, hee hee.

<boxstart/>Cloud!?<boxstart/>Why are you dressed like that!? And what are you doing here!?<boxstart/>Forget that, what happened to you after the fall!? Are you hurt!?
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Hey, give me a chance to answer.<boxstart/>I'm dressed like this...... because there was no other way to get in here.<boxstart/>I'm all right. Aerith helped me out.
<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>Oh, Aerith did...
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Tifa, explain. What are you doing in a place like this?
<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>Yeah, ummm......
<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>Ahem!! I'll just plug my ears.
She walks a short distance away and puts her hands to her ears.
<boxstart/>Please, go on with your private conversation.
<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>...I'm glad you're OK.
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Thanks. What happened?
<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>When we got back from the Number 5 reactor, there was this weird man.<boxstart/>So Barret caught him and squeezed some information out of him.
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>That's when the Don's name popped up.
<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>Right, Don Corneo.<boxstart/>Barret told me to leave the lech alone...<boxstart/>But something's been bothering me.
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>I see. So you wanted to get the story straight from Corneo's mouth.
<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>So I made it here, but now I'm in a bind.<boxstart/>Corneo is looking for a bride.<boxstart/>Everyday, he gets three girls, chooses one of them, and then... ...and, well......<boxstart/>Anyway, I have to be the girl... or I'm out for tonight.
<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>Sorry... but I overheard...<boxstart/>If you know the three girls, there's no problem, right?
<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>I guess so, but...
<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>We have two here, right?
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>No, Aerith! I can't have you get involved.
<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>Oh? So it's all right for Tifa to be in danger?
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>No, I don't want Tifa in...
<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>Is it all right?
<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>I grew up in the slums... I'm used to danger.<boxstart/>Do you trust me?
<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>Yes. Thanks, Ms. Aerith.
<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>Call me Aerith.
<speaker name="Redhead in Suit">Redhead in Suit</speaker><boxstart/>He---y!!<boxstart/>It's time, ladies. The Don is waiting!<boxstart/>I told you not to wander around... I tell ya, women nowadays...<boxstart/>Hurry up, will ya!
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>I probably don't need to ask but the other girl is......<boxstart/>Me...... right?
<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>You're right, there was no need...
<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>...to ask.
<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>Ha ha... You know, if you look closely, you're not so bad...<boxstart/>I wonder what Barret would say if he could see you now...
<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>They're going to get suspicious if we don't hurry.
<stage>The three of them head back upstairs.</stage>
<speaker name="Redhead in Suit">Redhead in Suit</speaker><boxstart/>The Don's waiting in his room... Ha ha ha...
<stage>They enter Don Corneo's office, where he is seated at his desk, flanked by two lackeys.</stage>
<speaker name="Kotch">Kotch</speaker><boxstart/>All right, ladies!<boxstart/>Line up in front of the Don!
<stage>Cloud, Aerith, and Tifa line up in front of the desk, and Corneo jumps up.</stage>
<speaker name="Don Corneo">Don Corneo</speaker><boxstart/>Hmmm! Good, splendid!<boxstart/>Now, let's see... Which girl should I choose? Hmm---hmm---!
He walks to Cloud, who turns his head.
<boxstart/>This one?
He walks to Tifa.
<boxstart/>Or this one?<boxstart/>Woo-hoo, I've made up my mind!!<boxstart/>My choice for tonight is......
<stage>Depending on the items collected for Cloud's disguise, Don Corneo will choose one of the three.</stage>

  Tifa
  Aerith
  Cloud

<stage>Corneo walks to Tifa.</stage>
<speaker name="Don Corneo">Don Corneo</speaker><boxstart/>This little beauty!

<speaker name="Don Corneo">Don Corneo</speaker><boxstart/>Well then, shall we go my pretty!?
<stage>He starts for his bedroom and Tifa follows. After a scene change, Cloud ends up in the basement with a bunch of guys.</stage>
<speaker name="Scotch">Scotch</speaker><boxstart/>Hey guys! We've got guests.<boxstart/>We'll take REAL good care of you.<boxstart/>This is all thanks to the big boss, Don Corneo!

<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>No... I'm flattered, but no thanks.<boxstart/>Because...
<speaker name="Scotch">Scotch</speaker><boxstart/>Because......?
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Because...<boxstart/>I ain't INTERESTED in a buncha scrubs like you!!

<speaker name="Scotch">Scotch</speaker><boxstart/>Wha... a MAN!???<boxstart/>God damn it! You think you can get away with this! Get him! Knock the crap out of him!!
<stage>Cloud fights off three of Corneo's lackeys.</stage>
<speaker name="Scotch">Scotch</speaker><boxstart/>Grr! C'mon, what's the matter with you good for nothings!?<boxstart/>All right now, COME ON! I'll show you how it's done!!
<stage>Cloud dispatches Scotch and the other two lackeys. He then hurries back towards the other basement room, where Kotch is chasing Aerith around.</stage>
<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>No---!!
<speaker name="Kotch">Kotch</speaker><boxstart/>Ha ha ha... Wait you!!
<stage>Aerith runs up the steps towards Cloud, then turns around to give Kotch a shove.</stage>
<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>I'm so sorry!!
<speaker name="Kotch">Kotch</speaker><boxstart/>oh, oh, oh......
He falls down the stairs.
