<stage>On Tifa's desk is a report.</stage>
"Periodic Report to Professor Hojo"<boxstart/><boxstart/>1 Clone Activity Report<boxstart/><boxstart/>Unfortunately, no 'CLONES' have left this town this quarter.<boxstart/>As previously reported, the 'CLONES' seem to be sensing something.<boxstart/>But all they say is, 'reunion' or 'Sephiroth' and show no other signs of activity.<boxstart/><boxstart/>2 Confidentiality Report<boxstart/><boxstart/>A total of eight people have visited this town this quarter.<boxstart/>Fortunately, none knew about the incident five years ago.<boxstart/>Therefore, no one knows the town was restored exactly as it was five years ago.<boxstart/>Our staff, disguised as townspeople have improved their acting skills, and we do not report any problems at this time.<boxstart/>That is all.
<stage>In the neighboring house's attic...</stage>
<speaker name="Small Clone">Small Clone</speaker><boxstart/>...Re...... union.
<speaker name="Smaller Clone">Smaller Clone</speaker><boxstart/>............ion
<stage>Cloud looks back and forth between them and sighs.</stage>
<speaker name="Smaller Clone">Smaller Clone</speaker><boxstart/>..................
<stage>Outside the Shinra mansion are another two clones.</stage>
<speaker name="Clone">Clone</speaker><boxstart/>Wooooo-----ooow...... He's... calling...... Sephiroth...... is...... calling......

<stage>Inside the mansion...</stage>
<speaker name="Letter">Letter</speaker><boxstart/>I must get rid of all those that stand in the way of my research. Even that one from the Turks.<boxstart/>I scientifically altered him, and put him to sleep in the basement. If you want to find him, then search the area.<boxstart/>But... this is merely a game I thought of. It is not necessary for you to participate if you don't want to.
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>There seems to be another letter.<boxstart/>- Read it<boxstart/>- Ignore it
<speaker name="Letter">Letter</speaker><boxstart/>Move the dial on the safe carefully, but quickly. You have 20 seconds. You can not go past the numbers while turning. The 4 hints for the numbers are...

  dial (1)<boxstart/>The lid of the box with the most oxygen.
  dial (2)<boxstart/>Behind the Ivory's short of tea and ray.
  dial (3)<boxstart/>The creek in the floor near the chair on the second floor... then to the left five steps, up nine steps, left two steps, and up six steps.
  <boxstart/>The fourth row has been written in invisible ink... Dial (4) is (Right 97)

<stage>At the safe on the second floor...</stage>
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>I have a bad feeling about this...<boxstart/>- Still open the safe<boxstart/>- Don't open
<stage>Cloud opens the safe and fights the Lost Number.</stage>
Received Key Item "Key to the Basement"!
<stage>The party heads down to the basement. Using the key, they enter the room with the coffins and approach the closed one in the center.</stage>
<stage><speaker name="* Note:">* Note:</speaker> Because it's possible to get Vincent after Cid joins the party, I've included his responses here as well.</stage>
<speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>...To wake me from the nightmare
He throws off the lid.
<boxstart/>Who is it!?
He sits up.
<boxstart/>...Never seen you before. You must leave.
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>You were having a nightmare.

	<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>I woke ya up. Ya outta be thankin' me.
	<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>You'll dream about bad things if you sleep in a place like THIS.
	<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>How bad was your dream?
	<speaker name="Nanaki">Nanaki</speaker><boxstart/>...You don't look good.
	<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Man, you really WERE having a bad dream! Even I feel bad!
	<speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>Aren't you glad you woke up?
	<speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>The air's pretty heavy here. How can you sleep in a place like this?

<speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>Hmph... a nightmare...? My long sleep has given me time to atone.
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>What are you saying?
<speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>I have nothing to say to strangers. Get out.<boxstart/>This mansion is the beginning of your nightmare.
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>...you can say that again.
<speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>Hmm? What do you know?
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>- Don't say a thing<boxstart/>- Talk about Sephiroth

  <speaker name="Cloud"><boxstart/>Don't say a thing</speaker>
  <speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>I see. Then, I'll return to my nightmare...<boxstart/>...What? More?
  <speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>- No, good night<boxstart/>- Tell him about Sephiroth


  <speaker name="Cloud"><boxstart/>Talk about Sephiroth</speaker>
  <stage>Cloud talks about Sephiroth.</stage>

<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Like you said, this mansion is the beginning of a nightmare.<boxstart/>No, it's not a dream, it's for real.<boxstart/>Sephiroth has lost his mind. He found the secrets hidden in this mansion...
<speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>Sephiroth!?
<speaker name="Cloud + Vincent">Cloud + Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>You know Sephiroth?
<stage>Vincent leaps from the coffin and lands on its edge.</stage>
<speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>You start first.
<stage>Cloud gestures as he tells his story.</stage>
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>...That's how it was.
<speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>So Sephiroth knows he was created five years ago? And about the Jenova Project?<boxstart/>...He was missing, but has just recently reappeared.<boxstart/>He has taken many lives and is seeking the Promised Land.
<stage>* <speaker name="Note">Note</speaker>: Vincent's comment here is likely a translation error and should have been something like "So five years ago, Sephiroth learned that he had been created?"</stage>
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Now it's your turn.
<speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>Sorry... I cannot speak.

	<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Hey! You lyin' white-faced!
	<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>That's dirty!
	<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>Hmm... I'm disappointed.
	<speaker name="Nanaki">Nanaki</speaker><boxstart/>What... you're serious?
	<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Oh, that's okay. It was probably depressing anyway.
	<speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>Hey, that's not right---
	<speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>Good! I'm not in the mood to hear long stories. Let's get the hell outta here!

<speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>Hearing your stories, has added upon me yet another sin.<boxstart/>More nightmares shall come to me now, more than I previously had.
He gets back into the coffin.
<boxstart/>Now... please leave.<boxstart/>...You're still here.
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>- Good night<boxstart/>- Who are you?

  <speaker name="Cloud"><boxstart/>Good night</speaker>
  <stage>Nothing happens.</stage>


  <speaker name="Cloud"><boxstart/>Who are you?</speaker>
  At least tell us your name.

<speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>I was with... the Shinra Manufacturing Department in Administrative Research, otherwise known as--the Turks...<boxstart/>Vincent.
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>The Turks!?
<speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>Formerly of the Turks.<boxstart/>I have no affiliation with Shinra now.<boxstart/>...And you?
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Cloud, formerly of SOLDIER.
<speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>You were also with Shinra...? Then do you know Lucrecia?
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Who?
<speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>......Lucrecia.
<stage>Cloud shakes his head.</stage>
<speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>The woman who gave birth to Sephiroth.
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>...gave birth...?<boxstart/>Wasn't Jenova Sephiroth's mother?
<speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>That isn't completely wrong, but just a theory.<boxstart/>He was born from a beautiful lady.<boxstart/>That lady was Lucrecia.<boxstart/>She was an assistant to Professor Gast of the Jenova Project. Beautiful... Lucrecia.
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>...A human experiment?
<speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>There was no way to cancel the experiment.<boxstart/>I couldn't stop her.<boxstart/>That was my sin.<boxstart/>I let the one I loved, the one I respected most, face the worst.

	<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>That why you started sleepin' in a box? Gimme a break!
	<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>So your punishment was to sleep? That's... kinda weird.
	<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>So the punishment was sleep? That's weird.
	<speaker name="Nanaki">Nanaki</speaker><boxstart/>So you slept as punishment? Isn't that strange? That thinking...
	<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>OK. Boring story no. 1.
	<speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>You think that's punishing yourself? You're just sleeping.
	<speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>You shouldn't sleep just because of that. Sleep?

<stage>Vincent lies back down.</stage>
<speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>Let me sleep...
<stage>Cloud and the others start back down the hallway.</stage>
<speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>Wait!<boxstart/>If I go with you will I meet Hojo?
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Dunno. But we're after him and Sephiroth. So, I guess sooner or later...
<speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>Lucrecia...<boxstart/>All right. I've decided to go with you.

	<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>W, what?
	<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>Sure is a quick change of heart. Huh?
	<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>What? You're coming with us?
	<speaker name="Nanaki">Nanaki</speaker><boxstart/>What?
	<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Huh? Oh great just what I needed...
	<speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>What?
	<speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>Hey, hold on sleepy. You're pretty damn pushy!

<speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>Being a former Turks, I may be of help to you...
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>All right, then.
<stage>Moving onward to the library, they find Sephiroth standing in the hallway leading to the study.</stage>
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Sephiroth!
<speaker name="Sephiroth">Sephiroth</speaker><boxstart/>Being here brings back memories.<boxstart/>Are you going to participate in the Reunion?
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>I don't even know what a Reunion is!
<speaker name="Sephiroth">Sephiroth</speaker><boxstart/>Jenova will be at the Reunion. Jenova will join the Reunion becoming a calamity from the skies.
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Jenova, a calamity from the skies? You mean she wasn't an Ancient!?
<speaker name="Sephiroth">Sephiroth</speaker><boxstart/>...I see. I don't think you have the right to participate.<boxstart/>I will go North past Mt. Nibel. If you wish to find out... then follow...
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>...Reunion? Calamity from the skies?
<stage>Sephiroth throws a materia orb at Cloud and then flies past him out of the library.</stage>
<speaker name="Glass Tank">Glass Tank</speaker><boxstart/>C project specimen (B) codeC<boxstart/>A scratch left by a fingernail inside the beaker... 'Let's get out of here...'.
