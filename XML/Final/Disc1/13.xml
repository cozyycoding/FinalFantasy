Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing

Exploring the Ship
A Suspicious Character
Sephiroth

<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>We'll cross the ocean, to the new continent.<boxstart/>...even if we are wearing Shinra's uniforms...
<stage>In the cargo hold, there are a few others in Shinra uniform. The sailors are busy with various tasks and the soldiers are apparently standing guard...</stage>
<speaker name="Sailor">Sailor</speaker><boxstart/>I'm workin' hard already, and you still want me to do more?<boxstart/>The new President's probably the same.<boxstart/>He's just gonna order us around anyway.
<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Urrrgh... This is why... I hate ships.<boxstart/>Hey, Cloud. You have any 'Tranquilizers'?
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>- Here, use this<boxstart/>- Nope

  <speaker name="Cloud"><boxstart/>Here, use this</speaker>
  <speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Thanks... Gross... this is bitter.


  <speaker name="Cloud"><boxstart/>Nope</speaker>
  <speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>...unless it's an emergency get away from me.

<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Where are the others?
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>I dunno. Aren't they hiding somewhere around here?
<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>How should I know...? Ugh...... urk......
<stage>Cloud jumps back, and moves on to find the others.</stage>
<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>Umm...... It's me Aerith.<boxstart/>Hey, Cloud. Did you see the Airship at Junon?
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>...I heard it was big, but I didn't expect it to be THAT big.
<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>That was REALLY something.<boxstart/>Hey, do you think I could get on it?
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>- I'll take you someday<boxstart/>- I dunno...

  <speaker name="Cloud"><boxstart/>I'll take you someday</speaker>
  ...keep hoping.
  <speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>Wow! I'm really looking forward to it!<boxstart/>Let's ride the Airship together, OK? Promise, promise me!


  <speaker name="Cloud"><boxstart/>I dunno...</speaker>
  ...It's a Shinra weapon. We probably should've destroyed it.
  <speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>...Hmm. But just once, I'd like to ride it.<boxstart/>Just once, I'd like to ride that Airship.

<speaker name="Sailor 2">Sailor 2</speaker><boxstart/>It won't do any good trying to stop me!<boxstart/>All right! I'm going to show the new President what I'm made of!
<speaker name="Soldier">Soldier</speaker><boxstart/>Hey, get to work!<boxstart/>Both the new President Rufus and Heidegger are aboard this ship!<boxstart/>If we do good, we could get promoted!
<stage>Cloud goes up to the deck. He finds Tifa up on the lookout tower.</stage>
<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>Yes sir! Everything quiet, sir!<boxstart/>...But, you know what? I really hate this uniform.<boxstart/>Uniforms, soldiers, war, I hate 'em all.<boxstart/>They take away all the things and people you love...<boxstart/>I wish they'd all disappear. Right, Cloud?
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>- Yeah......<boxstart/>- I don't know

  <speaker name="Cloud"><boxstart/>Yeah......</speaker>
  <speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>You're right!<boxstart/>Uh, yes sir, I'll continue my watch sir! Hee hee...


  <speaker name="Cloud"><boxstart/>I don't know</speaker>
  <speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>...Cloud. Wearing those clothes seems to have changed you a little.<boxstart/>Does it remind you of being in SOLDIER? I hope not...

<speaker name="Sailor 3">Sailor 3</speaker><boxstart/>President Rufus and his men are in the Bridge of the Ship. If they see you slacking, they'll bust you one!
<speaker name="Sailor 4">Sailor 4</speaker><boxstart/>Hey! What's wrong, kid? You got no pep!<boxstart/>A seaman's gotta have umph!
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>- I'm tired...<boxstart/>- Something's missing<boxstart/>- Leave me alone

  <speaker name="Cloud"><boxstart/>I'm tired...</speaker>
  <speaker name="Sailor 4">Sailor 4</speaker><boxstart/>I got just the perfect thing! 'Invisible Alpha'-- A super drink for seamen!!<boxstart/>Just one'll rejuvenate you! Only 250 gil!
  <speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>- I'll take it<boxstart/>- No thanks
  
    <speaker name="Cloud"><boxstart/>I'll take it</speaker>
    <speaker name="Sailor 4">Sailor 4</speaker><boxstart/>Thanks! This is a necessity for a sailor.<boxstart/>This is a must item for a sailor! Ha ha ha!
    HP/MP Restored!
  
  
    <speaker name="Cloud"><boxstart/>No thanks</speaker>
    <speaker name="Sailor 4">Sailor 4</speaker><boxstart/>Hey! Seamen shouldn't be so stingy!
  


  <speaker name="Cloud"><boxstart/>Something's missing</speaker>
  <speaker name="Sailor 4">Sailor 4</speaker><boxstart/>Ey ey! Whattaya mean, 'missin'!?
  <stage>An item shop menu opens.</stage>


  <speaker name="Cloud"><boxstart/>Leave me alone</speaker>
  <stage>Nothing happens.</stage>

<speaker name="Soldier 2">Soldier 2</speaker><boxstart/>Oh man, we're almost to Costa del Sol.<boxstart/>When I get there, I'm going to take a long overdue vacation. Maybe I'll go down to the beach and get a tan...
<speaker name="Red XIII">Red XIII</speaker><boxstart/>......<boxstart/>......It's me.<boxstart/>Red XIII.<boxstart/>I'm a little woozy, but I shouldn't get caught.<boxstart/>Humans only look at appearances anyway.<boxstart/>Anyway you look at it, I'd say I make a fine human being.
He turns around, showing his tail sticking out the back of his uniform.
<boxstart/>It's pretty hard standing on two feet...
<stage>Back in the cargo hold...</stage>
<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>Hey, Cloud. Did you see Barret?<boxstart/>I hope he's not doing anything stupid...
<stage>Cloud goes back up to find Barret just outside the bridge, watching Rufus and Heidegger through the window.</stage>
<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Look, Cloud. It's Rufus and Heidegger.<boxstart/>They're this close but we can't do a thing to 'em...<boxstart/>Ummmm...... Gmmmmm......<boxstart/>How can he...... Goin' off laughin' like that?<boxstart/>Because of him, Biggs...... Wedge...... Jessie......!<boxstart/>Ggggggggh... Ggggh......! Ggggggghhh!!<boxstart/>God!! I can't take it anymore!<boxstart/>I'm gonna settle things here and now......
Emergency alert! Reports of a suspicious character found! Those not on detail, search the ship. Report when found!<boxstart/>I repeat. Suspicious character found on board! Those not on detail, search the ship. Report when found!
<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Damn, did they find us!?<boxstart/>Hey, that don't seem like us. Do they mean... Tifa and the others!?<boxstart/>Get off your spikey butt and let's go, Cloud!
<stage>Barret and Cloud join the others gathered on the deck of the ship.</stage>
<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>Everyone all right!?
<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>You all right!?
<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>Huh?
<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>Everyone's here... right?
<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Hey, wait.<boxstart/>You don't think that suspicious character is...
<speaker name="Someone">Someone</speaker><boxstart/>Sephiroth!?
<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>Really!?
<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>How the hell am I supposed to know!?
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>...Let's find out.
<speaker name="Red XIII">Red XIII</speaker><boxstart/>It's the most logical thing to do. Then, who's going to go?
<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker> (backing away)<boxstart/>N, not me...<boxstart/>I don't even like Sephiroth anyway. And beside...... ugh...... urk......
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>...... Sephiroth......<boxstart/>......All right, let's go!
<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>I'm goin' too!
<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>Is it really Sephiroth......?
<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>Take me with you!
<speaker name="Red XIII">Red XIII</speaker><boxstart/>These clothes are too tight on me. Can I switch with you?
<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>I told you... I don't want... to, ugh...... urk......
<speaker name="Sailor 4">Sailor 4</speaker><boxstart/>Say, who are you? You're not a part of the crew.<boxstart/>Oh well, seamen never bother with details!<boxstart/>How you feelin'!
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>- I'm tired...<boxstart/>- Something's missing<boxstart/>- Leave me alone
<stage>Cloud the others go down into the cargo hold, where two sailors and a soldier lie motionless on the floor.</stage>
<speaker name="Soldier">Soldier</speaker><boxstart/>...the Engine Room... ...a suspicious...... character...<boxstart/>No...... there's no way...... that...... not a human...... That thing's not human......
<stage>Cloud enters the engine room and walks up to the one soldier still standing.</stage>
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Is it...... Sephiroth?
<stage>The man turns around and collapses.</stage>
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>No... not Sephiroth!
<speaker name="Sephiroth">Sephiroth</speaker><boxstart/>......After a long sleep...<boxstart/>...the time......<boxstart/>...time has...... come...

	<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Look, Cloud!!
	<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>Look, Cloud!!
	<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>Cloud, look!!
	<speaker name="Red XIII">Red XIII</speaker><boxstart/>Over there, Cloud.
	<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Ov...... over there!!

<stage>Sephiroth rises up through the floor of the engine room.</stage>
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Sephiroth! You're alive!
<speaker name="Sephiroth">Sephiroth</speaker><boxstart/>......Who are you?
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>You don't remember me!? I'm Cloud!
<speaker name="Sephiroth">Sephiroth</speaker><boxstart/>Cloud...
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Sephiroth! What are you thinking!? What are you doing!?
<speaker name="Sephiroth">Sephiroth</speaker><boxstart/>...the time...... is now...
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>What!? What are you saying? Be more......
<stage>Sephiroth flies off through the ceiling, and Cloud's party enters a battle with Jenova∙BIRTH, fighting and defeating it. A small tentacle-like piece remains after the battle.</stage>

	<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Isn't he...... that guy?
	<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>I've seen this before...
	<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>I've seen this somewhere... before.
	<speaker name="Red XIII">Red XIII</speaker><boxstart/>That's what disappeared from the Shinra building...
	<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Eeeew! What IS it! GROSS!

<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>...Jenova. The arm of Jenova.

	<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Jenova...You mean he's been walkin' around with that thing?
	<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>Jenova... With this thing?
	<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>Jenova... He's been carrying this thing around?
	<speaker name="Red XIII">Red XIII</speaker><boxstart/>Sephiroth took Jenova... What does it mean?
	<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Gag... I'm feeling sick as it is without you having to show me THIS...

<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>So it WAS Sephiroth.

	<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>He said the time is now.
	<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>The time is now... I think that was what was said.
	<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>He said something about it being time for something.
	<speaker name="Red XIII">Red XIII</speaker><boxstart/>The time is now...? What does that mean?
	<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>He was mumbling something about time!

<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>......Time... is now?

	<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>I don't know WHAT the hell's goin' on!<boxstart/>Cloud, why don't you explain to me what's happened so far?
	<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>Hmm... I don't get it.<boxstart/>Hey, Cloud. Can you explain it to us?
	<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>I'm getting so confused...<boxstart/>Cloud, explain what's happened so far.
	<speaker name="Red XIII">Red XIII</speaker><boxstart/>Hmm... The story's not that simple.<boxstart/>Cloud, why don't you summarize what's happened so far?
	<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>So what's the story?<boxstart/>Hey Cloud. Give us a quick run down.

<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>- I'll try<boxstart/>- Too much trouble [With this choice, he doesn't say anything more.]
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>...I'll try, but don't interrupt me while I'm explaining.<boxstart/>Sephiroth went off searching for the Promised Land, so he could become the ruler of the planet... That was 5 years ago.<boxstart/>Then Sephiroth came back and killed President Shinra.<boxstart/>And then just now all of us saw Sephiroth.<boxstart/>He was carrying Jenova with him.<boxstart/>...This much I do know. He told me he wants to go to the Promised Land with his mother, Jenova.<boxstart/>...I guess that's about it.
Dock workers--We will be docking in Costa del Sol in 5 minutes. Prepare for docking.

	<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Whoa! We'd best hurry and hide somewhere.
	<speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>Maybe we shouldn't stay in here anymore...
	<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>We should hide somewhere again.
	<speaker name="Red XIII">Red XIII</speaker><boxstart/>I don't think it's wise to stay here any longer.
	<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Phew... We're finally here... Now we gotta hide......

<stage>The others start for the exit. Cloud turns back to look at where Sephiroth was.</stage>
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Sephiroth... is alive...<boxstart/>The Promised Land... Does it really exist...?
<stage>The cargo ship continues on to dock at Costa del Sol.</stage>
