Cosmo Canyon - Bugenhagen's Farewell

<stage>Entering without Nanaki...</stage>
<speaker name="Gatekeeper">Gatekeeper</speaker><boxstart/>Bugenhagen seems rather down ever since he returned from that trip.<boxstart/>I'm worried something might happen to Bugenhagen now of all times...
<stage>With Nanaki...</stage>
<speaker name="Gatekeeper">Gatekeeper</speaker><boxstart/>Nanaki, it's really bad. Ever since Bugenhagen returned from that last trip, he doesn't seem well.<boxstart/>Why don't you hurry and see Bugenhagen?
<speaker name="Elder Bugah">Elder Bugah</speaker><boxstart/>Where is the Promised Land...? Maybe Bugenhagen knows.<boxstart/>Isn't Nanaki starting to notice? The reason why Bugenhagen sent him away from the canyon...
<speaker name="Kid in Nanaki's Room">Kid in Nanaki's Room</speaker><boxstart/>He's finally come home, but Mr. Bugenhagen doesn't seem well...<boxstart/>I want to hear Mr. Bugenhagen's talk with Nanaki like we used to do...
<speaker name="Elder Hargo">Elder Hargo</speaker><boxstart/>I think Bugenhagen has foreseen it.<boxstart/>About the planet... About Nanaki... And, about himself...<boxstart/>But, Bugehnagen would never say that. All he says is 'Ho Ho Hoooo'...
<stage>In the living quarters next to the materia shop...</stage>
<speaker name="Kid">Kid</speaker><boxstart/>What's wrong with Bugenhagen? Is he sick?
<speaker name="Woman">Woman</speaker><boxstart/>No need to be sad, even if something should happen. Everything will return to the planet... Bugenhagen says so.<boxstart/>Just the thought of something happening to Bugenhagen... worries me.
<stage>Upon reaching the observatory, Nanaki runs ahead.</stage>
<speaker name="Nanaki">Nanaki</speaker><boxstart/>Grandfather!!
<stage>Cloud shakes his head and decides to leave Nanaki alone with Bugenhagen, who is lying on a couch on the second floor.</stage>
<speaker name="Nanaki">Nanaki</speaker><boxstart/>Grandfather!!
<speaker name="Bugenhagen">Bugenhagen</speaker><boxstart/>...Nanaki...? ...you're still...... here?
<speaker name="Nanaki">Nanaki</speaker><boxstart/>I can't leave you like this, grandfather...!<boxstart/>It's the duty of my... Seto's son, to guard this canyon and her people...
<speaker name="Bugenhagen">Bugenhagen</speaker><boxstart/>...listen, Nanaki. I think you may already know.<boxstart/>If you have any mission in life, it is not to defend this valley.<boxstart/>Look at the withering mountain grass. Listen to the warble of the new born chocobo's.<boxstart/>Look always to the eternal flow of time which is far greater than the span of a human life.<boxstart/>It will teach you more, than staying here in the valley...<boxstart/>What you will see will eventually become a part of life's dream.<boxstart/>For my children...... And for your children......<boxstart/>So please, Nanaki... Go with Cloud... And with your eyes... your ears...
<speaker name="Nanaki">Nanaki</speaker><boxstart/>.........
<speaker name="Bugenhagen">Bugenhagen</speaker><boxstart/>Ho Ho...... Hoooo. Now, now. Don't look like that. I'm all right.<boxstart/>It's a wide world and you must go out and see it... You may even find your life's mate. You never know.
<speaker name="Nanaki">Nanaki</speaker><boxstart/>Grandfather......
<speaker name="Bugenhagen">Bugenhagen</speaker><boxstart/>Oh yes... take this along. I think it will look good on you now.<boxstart/>Ho Ho......
<stage>He slumps back, and Nanaki starts. Fade to black.</stage>
<stage>Cloud is waiting at the Candle. He stands when Nanaki arrives.</stage>
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Nanaki... Is Bugenhagen...?
<speaker name="Nanaki">Nanaki</speaker><boxstart/>......<boxstart/>Grandpa told me that he's going away again!
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Away...?
<speaker name="Nanaki">Nanaki</speaker><boxstart/>It seems like he really liked that Airship.<boxstart/>He told me he couldn't stay still and just zipped out of here!<boxstart/>He even gave me a gift, look!
Received "Limited Moon"!
<speaker name="Nanaki">Nanaki</speaker><boxstart/>Wait a minute. Aren't you supposed to give gifts AFTER you come back?<boxstart/>Ha ha...... Grandpa sure is strange! Haa... ha ha...... ha......
He shakes his head.
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Hmm... So maybe we'll run into him again somewhere.
<speaker name="Nanaki">Nanaki</speaker><boxstart/>Yeah... maybe...<boxstart/>Thanks, Cloud......
<stage>Cloud shakes his head.</stage>
<speaker name="Gatekeeper">Gatekeeper</speaker><boxstart/>Bugenhagen is what keeps our hearts strong...
