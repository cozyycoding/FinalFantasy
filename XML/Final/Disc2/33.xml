<sp> Finding Cloud </sp>
<sp> Shinra's Huge Materia Plan </sp>
<sp> A New Leader </sp>

<sp> Tifa leads the way into Mideel. </sp>
<sp> Old Man at EntranceAhoy! Hey ain't you a beaut. This here's Mideel. It's a quiet little Hot Springs town.Just the perfect place for old folks like us to live out our lives.I hear that things ain't so peaceful on the outside. But here it's still nice and quiet. </sp>
<sp> In the Item Shop... </sp>
<sp> ShopperBut anyhow, that overgrown moon is going to fall down on us isn't it?This's no joke! We've got to start stocking up on supplies before they're all gone!Outta the way! Hey, move it, move it! </sp>
<sp> ShopkeeperWelcome! We always welcome cash! Now, about where you want to go...I'm afraid other customers have already booked it up. There's nothing left.......just kidding! Just a little joke. Now what can I do for you?Thank you! Come again! </sp>
<sp> Girl in Blue OutsideGather 'round, gather 'round, this is a bargain!!We've got the best armor and weapons, the likes of which you won't find anywhere else.But it's first come first served, so get yours now!Step right up! You there, don't just stand around outside.Go on in! Come on! Don't be shy, step right up!I'll never know why he wanted to open a store in a dead town like this. What's up with him......? ...sigh...... </sp>
<sp> On the upper platform at the far left... </sp>
<sp> ManEverything must come to an end. And someday it's gonna be your turn. Even the world's gotta end sometime.Everybody leaves at one time or another. And everyone gets left also. That's just fate...It's sad, but there's nothing that can be done about it. So that's why I'm prayin' like this for all of you. </sp>
<sp> As she walks past him, there is a clinking noise. </sp>
<sp> TifaHuh......? What could that be?There's something stuck deep inside that looks like a key... It's hard to get out.Well, I'll just let it go for now...... </sp>
<sp> In the Weapons Shop... </sp>
<sp> ShopperYou again! You aren't here hoarding up goods too are you?Don't reach in front of me! Everything in this store is mine!I've got money to burn! I've been saving it like mad just for a time like this!C'mon, outta the way! Move, will you? Move! </sp>
<sp> ShopkeeperWelcome to the charity store, a store of love and courage! What can I get you today?Thank you very much! Please come again. </sp>
<sp> In the back of the store is a door. Tifa knocks on it. </sp>
<sp> TifaNo good... I wonder if it's locked? </sp>
<sp> She returns to the key. </sp>
<sp> TifaI wonder if there isn't some way to get this outta here...?If I just move this...... And push that...... Okay! I got it out! </sp>
<sp> Or, if she didn't notice the key earlier: </sp>
<sp> There's something stuck deep inside that looks like an old key... </sp>
<sp> Received a "Beat-up Useless Old Key"! </sp>
<sp> Inside the nearby house... </sp>
<sp> WomanYou say you don't know when the stars are gonna fall outta the sky? Is that for real?I still don't believe it! How could this be happen? </sp>
<sp> Old ManAncient Weapon? End of the world? I don't know nothing about that! I'm gonna live to be a hundred!There's tons of stuff I still gotta do! This's just the beginning.And what have Shinra and SOLDIER done about it? Tell me! They're a waste!! </sp>
<sp> GirlActually, I'm a beautiful maid. I just work here in the accessory store part-time.Everything here can compare with the best goods anywhere. So, how about one?Thank you. Stop by again. </sp>
<sp> Back to the Weapons Shop, Tifa again inspects the door... </sp>
<sp> TifaOh yeah, shall I try that old beat up key?- Use the beat up old key!- Forget it </sp>

  Use the beat up old key!
  Okay, this is it.hmm. Huh...? This is pretty tight...Eyaaah...!?Oh no! ......it broke. Now I can't get it out...
  ShopkeeperIs something wrong......?
  TifaUlp!?Huh? Uh, no......What am I gonna do......?- Lie your butt off!- Tell them the truth!
  
    Lie your butt off!
    Nothing! I was just thinking how nice that door was, that's all.
    ShopkeeperOh... why, thank you very much.
    TifaWhew... that was close. But that was kind of bad...
    Tifa looks at the door.
    ...... The key's broken off inside, and I can't get to it......... I don't know anything about it.
  
  
    Tell them the truth!
    I'm... sorry! I forced the key and it broke!
    ShopkeeperHuh? Key? You mean the one to that door?
    Tifa nods.
    ShopkeeperHah, hah, hah! That's a good one!
    Tifa???
    ShopkeeperOf course there's no key. It's a wall. We just painted a door on it.
    TifaWhat!? It's not a real door?
    ShopkeeperThat's right. We drew it on there to make it feel like you could pass through it to another world.Sorry to have surprised you. It's not much of an apology, but please take this.
    TifaReally? Thank you.
    Tifa and the others received "Cursed Ring"!
    ShopkeeperIf possible, we're hoping to pass through a dream door like that one into another worldI got the feeling that you all might be able to make my dreams come true in my place. Weird, isn't it?
  


  Forget it
  I'd better not. It doesn't look like it even fits.

<sp> WomanHuh? Never seen you here before. You from outta town? How're things on the outside?Between the earthquakes and Meteor...... It just might be the end of the world like everyone's been sayin'...Oh, how depressing! What a miserable world this is...... </sp>
<sp> In the Materia shop... </sp>
<sp> ShopperOh...... there's not much time left!! You never know when that moon is gonna come crashing down!!When it all comes down to it, this world's about money and material things!If you got 'em, you can get by whenever, wherever!Gotta buy!! Gotta buy, buy, buy!! I'm gonna shop till I drop!! </sp>
<sp> ShopkeeperAh, welcome to you! What I get you to-day?Thank very much! You come 'gain. </sp>
<sp> Outside, Tifa comes across a lone dog. </sp>
<sp> TifaWhat's the matter? Are you all alone? </sp>
<sp> She kneels down in front of it as it whines. </sp>
<sp> You got lost didn't you? Separated from someone you love......? Silly thing... </sp>
<sp> Bald Man......guess it's been about a week now since he washed up here on the shore... Poor pokey-headed young thing... </sp>
<sp> Old ManIt was really sad...... but weird. he was holding this really long sword.I dunno. The whole thing feels unlucky to me. But the amazing thing was those weird blue eyes...... </sp>
<sp> TifaWha!? </sp>
<sp> She jumps up. </sp>
<sp> Wh...... wait a minute!! What did you just say!? </sp>
<sp> She runs over to the two men. </sp>
<sp> Excuse me! That young person you were just talking about...... </sp>
<sp> Bald ManYeah... a villager found him a little ways down the coast... It was about a week ago I think. </sp>
<sp> Old ManYeah, poor kid...... He must've drifted from somewhere pretty far away... </sp>
<sp> TifaCloud!! It must be!! It's Cloud!! </sp>

	BarretYou sure!?
	NanakiOver here!
	YuffieBINGO!!
	Cait SithJackpot!
	VincentYou've found him.
	CidHeh, good job, Tifa.

<sp> TifaSo where is he? Is he safe!? Where is he now......? </sp>
<sp> Bald ManYeah... up ahead here... At the, uh, clinic...... </sp>
<sp> TifaHe's alive...!Cloud...... Cloud's alive!! </sp>
<sp> She runs off towards the clinic. </sp>
<sp> Cloud......!! </sp>

	BarretUh...!? Yo, Tifa!
	NanakiHalt!
	YuffieHey!!
	Cait SithWait up!

<sp> Tifa runs into the clinic. </sp>
<sp> TifaCloud!? </sp>
<sp> DoctorHere now. The way you're running around here, you'd think Meteor fell or something. </sp>
<sp> TifaI'm sorry, but I heard that a friend of mine was being taken care of here...... </sp>
<sp> DoctorA friend...?Oh yeah......! That young fellow!?Don't worry. Your friend is next door. But I'm afraid his condition is... </sp>
<sp> TifaHere?Over here. </sp>
<sp> She runs into the next room, where Cloud is sitting in a wheelchair with a nurse near him. </sp>
<sp> Cloud...!? </sp>
<sp> The nurse steps aside and lowers her head. The doctor comes to the doorway as the others run into the clinic. </sp>
<sp> TifaOh... Cloud!! I'm so glad you're safe!?......!?Cloud......? </sp>
<sp> CloudUh...... aaa......? </sp>
<sp> TifaWh...... what's wrong...... Cloud......? </sp>
<sp> CloudA...... Gurk......? </sp>
<sp> TifaCloud! What happened to you......!? </sp>
<sp> DoctorMako poisoning...... Quite an advanced case......It appears this young man's been exposed to a high level of Mako energy for a protracted period of time.He probably has no idea who or where he is now......Poor fellow, his voice doesn't even work. He is literally miles away from us.Some place far away where no one's ever been... All alone...... </sp>
<sp> TifaDoctor......!! </sp>

	BarretThat's bad......
	NanakiHow horrible......
	YuffieYou lyin' or what!?
	Cait SithThat's terrible......
	Vincent.........
	CidDamn...... that's evil.

<sp> Tifa drops to her knees before Cloud. </sp>
<sp> TifaCloud...... </sp>
<sp> DoctorAhem! Let us excuse ourselves.Listen, would you all mind...... waiting outside? </sp>
<sp> Barret...... </sp>
<sp> Everyone files outside, leaving Tifa alone with Cloud. </sp>
<sp> TifaWhy......? What do you want me to do?Please, Cloud...... Talk to me......Tell me you see me, that you can hear me...... Tell me, please......I came this far believing in the memories we have together...This isn't happening......! This is too cruel......Oh, Cloud......! I............ </sp>
<sp> Meanwhile, outside... </sp>

	BarretSo what about him? You know...... Cloud?
	NanakiTell me doctor, is Cloud all right? I mean will he heal?
	YuffieHey doc, is he okay? Is he gonna heal?
	Cait SithHey doctor, is Cloud all right? Is he gonna get better? Come on, tell us the truth.
	CidListen Doc, why don't you tell us the truth.What about Cloud? Is he all right?

<sp> DoctorI'll say it again, he's got Mako poisoning. I've never seen a case this bad...An immense amount of Mako-drenched knowledge was put into his brain all at once......No normal human could have survived it...... It's a miracle he did! </sp>

	BarretNo wonder...... After fallin' in the Lifestream an' bein' washed up here......
	NanakiNo wonder. He fell into the Lifestream and was washed up here......
	YuffieNo lie. After fallin' head first into the Lifestream.
	Cait SithNo wonder. After falling into the Lifestream......
	CidNo wonder...... After all he fell into the Lifestream and was carried down here.

<sp> DoctorBut remember, the light of hope can be found anywhere.Listen, if you give up hope... What will happen to him? </sp>

	NanakiHmm, I know he'll recover! Cloud was a strong member of SOLDIER.
	YuffieYeah, that's right. Besides, WE'RE here for him. He's gotta get better!
	Cait SithYeah! I know Cloud'll get better!With friends like us worrying about him He can't go wrong.
	Cid......... Hope............I guess that's all that's left for us now......

<sp> Barret......hope......Hey, but honestly, man...... Do I really want him to come back?What did he do for the world? What can he do for us from here on out? He may be nothing more than Sephiroth's shadow...... </sp>
<sp> DoctorIs something wrong? </sp>
<sp> BarretNo, nothin'. Nothin' at all, doc. </sp>
<sp> Tifa steps outside. </sp>
<sp> Tifa......... </sp>

	BarretYou okay?
	NanakiAre you all right, Tifa?
	YuffieYou okay, Tifa?
	Cait SithYou all right?
	CidYou okay?

<sp> TifaYes...... I'm sorry I had you all worried.And I have something I want to tell you all...... </sp>
<sp> She turns back inside and the others follow. </sp>
<sp> TifaI don't care about anything else, only Cloud......I...... want to be by his side...... </sp>

	BarretYeah, that's probably best......For Cloud...... an' for you......
	NanakiYes, that's best!
	YuffieYou gotta do it then. You gotta live true to yourself.
	Cait SithIf Tifa was my nurse, I'd switch places with Cloud any day!
	VincentDo what you wish.
	CidYeah. Right. Hang in there, Tifa.

<sp> TifaI'm sorry, everyone... At a time like this...... </sp>

	BarretWhy you apologizin'? We'll come back again an' check on ya.
	NanakiThat's all right. We'll be by again.
	YuffieNo big, no big. I'll pop in again later.
	Cait SithWhat're you talkin' about? Not even. We'll stop in again.
	VincentDon't worry. We'll return and check on him later.
	CidDon't worry. I'll stop by again sometime.


	BarretYou take care now, Tifa. And take care of Cloud.
	NanakiDo your best, Tifa. Take care of Cloud.
	YuffieLook after Cloud. Take care, Tifa.
	Cait SithHope Cloud gets better soon.
	VincentTake care of him.
	CidYou hang in there, Tifa. Take care of Cloud.

<sp> TifaRight...... </sp>
<sp> BarretOh, and uh, Tifa... I don't like askin' this but......Is he really your childhood friend? And not Sephiroth's shadow? </sp>
<sp> TifaHuh!? Well... that is......No, I'm sure of it! </sp>
<sp> BarretYeah......? Okay then...... Sorry for askin' that. </sp>

	BarretWe gotta get back to the Highwind.
	NanakiWe should be getting back to the Highwind.
	YuffieHey, shouldn't we be gettin' back to the Highwind?
	Cait SithWell, I guess we'd better go back to the Highwind.
	VincentVery well then, we should be getting back to the Highwind.
	CidNow, we gotta be headin' back to the Highwind.


<sp> The others leave Tifa with Cloud and return to the Highwind. </sp>
<sp> BarretWhat're we gonna do now! What can WE do?Huh? Ain't there nothin' we can do?An' don' go tellin' us to wait for Cloud to get better. </sp>
<sp> Cait SithOh, I've got some news. </sp>
<sp> BarretYeah, what!? That you a spy? </sp>
<sp> Cait SithYeah...... I've already told you I was.Both gya ha ha and Kya ha ha, are up to something.Wanna eavesdrop? </sp>

<sp> In the Conference Room at Shinra HQ... </sp>
<sp> RufusNow then...... We're faced with two issues.1 Destroy Meteor. 2 Remove the barrier around North Cave and defeat Sephiroth.Any ideas? </sp>
<sp> HeideggerGya haah hah hah! We already solved the first problem!Meteor will soon be smashed to bits!The plan has already been put in motion. Namely, to collect Huge Materia from each region. </sp>
<sp> RufusWell...... </sp>
<sp> ScarletHuge Materia is a high density special type of materia made through a special compression process in Mako reactors.The energy extracted from it is 330 times the strength of normal materia.Ha, ha, ha! How about that!?We will gather all the Huge Materia together and ram it into Meteor.That will cause a huge explosion!! Reducing Meteor literally to bits. </sp>
<sp> RufusYou're going to ram Meteor?Do you think we have the technology to do it? </sp>
<sp> ScarletDon't worry about that!More importantly, we've got to collect Huge Materia from each area. </sp>
<sp> HeideggerWe've already collected materia from Nibelheim.All that's left is "Corel" and "Fort Condor".I've already dispatched troops to Corel.Ghaa haah hah hah! </sp>

<sp> Back on the Highwind... </sp>
<sp> BarretCorel!What else can they do to Corel!? </sp>
<sp> NanakiAnd the Huge Materia......You mean the Huge Materia, don't you? I've heard about it.When, our small materia nears the larger one, something should happen.I'm certain of it.That's why we're using the power of materia in our fight...... </sp>
<sp> BarretCan't let Shinra get a hold of the Huge Materia!Besides, when Cloud gets back, I wanna show him this Huge Materia. He's gonna be shocked. </sp>
<sp> Cait SithSo, what are you saying, Barret?Even though you're always knocking him, you really want Cloud to return. </sp>
<sp> BarretI ain't sayin' nothin' 'bout nothin'. You just... shut your face!Every group's gotta have a leader.An' that's me!Or at least I wanna be... But I ain't cut out to be no leader.I never knew that till lately.An' that's what is...... </sp>
<sp> Cid......ZZZZ...... hmph? </sp>
<sp> He wakes and gets to his feet. </sp>
<sp> Wha? What's goin' on? </sp>
<sp> BarretYou been chosen to be the new leader. </sp>
<sp> CidPain in the ass. Forget it. </sp>
<sp> BarretBut for us to fight, we gotta have Highwind, and you.We need it to save the Planet. An' who's runnin' this ship? You!That's why you're our new leader. Ain't no one else can. </sp>
<sp> CidHm...... this ship's gonna save the Planet, huh? Ain't that gonna be just a little tough?Oh man, that went straight to my heart.I'm a man, too!Okay, I'll do it! Everyone, follow me! </sp>
<sp> BarretAwright, now here's the first job.The Operation Room's waiting for you! </sp>
<sp> CidYeah!! </sp>
<sp> He runs off. </sp>
<sp> BarretYo, Cid!When you're ready, we're headin' for the Corel Reactor. C'mon Mr. leader, you'd better hurry. </sp>
<sp> YuffieCid......????I know you're all dyin' to talk to a babe like me!But just leave me alone. This ship makes me...... urk...!! </sp>
<sp> Crew MembersI'm not just shooting the breeze! I'm also working!Good day, Captain!Looks like you turned out to be the leader after all, Captain...... </sp>
<sp> BarretYo, Mr. Leader! Get your pilot ass up here! </sp>
<sp> NanakiCid.Let's visit Cloud and Tifa from time to time. </sp>
<sp> Cait SithHmmn, the Huge Materia is at Corel, Fort Condor......I'm sure there was another place that had it. Where was that......? </sp>
<sp> VincentCid...... I wish I had your go-get-them attitude.It appears my feelings vanished into thin air ever since I was in that long slumber...... </sp>
<sp> Pilot in training (LV6)Yaah! Shall we take off? </sp>
<sp> Cid- Yes- No </sp>
<sp> Pilot in training (LV6)Yaah! We're taking off! </sp>
