<sp> Fort Condor - Huge Materia </sp>

<sp> Because Fort Condor is optional until this point, it is possible for this to be the party's first visit. </sp>

<sp> If this is the party's first visit to Fort Condor... </sp>
	ManWe've been fighting the Shinra for a long time at this battlefield.Even now, we're still settled in for a long war with them.If you aren't in a hurry, would you help us fight them?Listen, we don't want to push you but, if you're in the middle of something, why don't you finish that first?
	Cid- Like to help but...- I guess we'll help you
	
	  Like to help but...
	  ManAll right then...... Take care of yourselves...
	
	
	  I guess we'll help you
	  ManReally!? Then go on up and they'll fill you in on the details.
	
	Cid and the others go inside. They find the man by himself in the shed at the top of the fort, looking out the window.
	ManDo you guys want to see it, too?
	CidWhat is it?
	ManThe condors. They're huge. Come on, have a look.
	Cid has a look out the window, seeing a huge condor nesting close to the Mako reactor that sits atop Fort Condor's hill.
	ManWhat do ya think? Awesome, huh?
	Man with HatHmmn, now this is something, I never thought anyone would ever climb up here.Any minute now, this will be a battlefield against Shinra. You'd better get down before you get involved.
	
		BarretShinra? The hell those jackasses doing here?
		NanakiShinra again.
		YuffieThe Shinra? Here too?
		Cait Sith......
		VincentWhat do you mean by that?
	
	CidA battlefield, we can't overlook that.
	Man with HatIt appears you have a problem with Shinra, too. After all, you climbed up here.Why not listen to what I have to say for a moment?
	CidAll right, talk on!
	Man with HatDo you know what's at the top of this mountain?
	
		BarretHuh? Something's up there?
		YuffieLook close, old man.
		Cait SithYeah, come to think of it there was something.
	
	CidNo matter how you look at it, that's a reactor. And on top of it, is that the Condor?
	Man with HatI can see you're very perceptive. Yes, it's a reactor and a condor.Looks like there's a special materia up in the Mako reactor.Then came the condor, so Shinra dispatched the troops to get rid of it.Their plan is to get rid of the condor and the people on this mountain and to get the materia from the Mako Reactor.Unfortunately, we don't have the ability to fight Shinra ourselves.That's why we have hired soldiers to help us.As our sponsor you can help us with a contribution or by fighting along side of us...What do you think? You want to join us in our fight?
	CidIf you go that far, what can I say. Well, we'll be able to do something if you leave it up to us.
	
		BarretHey! We'll come to the rescue.
		NanakiGot it. I'm gonna lend a hand, too.
		YuffieOkay, it's settled. We're gonna get the materia, right?
		Cait SithWell then, let's do our best.
		VincentThat's the right decision.
	
	Man with HatI'm begging you. Please prevent the reactor from being destroyed and the condors from being killed.
	They go on up to the shack.
	ManSo shall I let you in on our strategy?The enemy is targeting this mountain's reactor and will be climbing to reach it.We must set a trap and hire soldiers to protect this place.Well, this is all we have...... this village doesn't have any money. Even if we wanted to fight, our hands are tied 'cause we're broke.To hire one soldier, we need 400 gil. So, if we hire 20 soldiers, we must have 8000 gil.That is, we would like you to use your own money to hire these soldiers, buy the trap, set it up and give the commands.We know that we're asking is selfish. We sent our wives and kids to another village. We are resigned to our fate.Let's get back to square one. If the enemy penetrates this shed, you'll have to fight them off immediately.I know it's a one shot deal, but I'm asking for your help.Now then, is there anything you wish to ask?
	Cid- Enough
	ManReady?
	Cid- Wait- Okay, ready- Hear more


<sp> If the party has visited Fort Condor before... </sp>
	Man with HatYou've come at a good time. Shinra's changing its strategy now.It seems that Shinra will destroy the reactor and then take out the materia that's inside.
	
		BarretMan, we're walking on dangerous ground. We can't lose now!
		NanakiWe can't afford to be beaten!
		YuffieIf we lose here, all the materia we gathered will be for nothing.
		Cait SithYou're right. If we lose here, we'll be in great danger.
		VincentWe must protect this area.
	
	CidDamn! I guess we have to protect this area, too.
	They go on up to the shack.
	ManThe situation has changed. Looks like the enemy is set to attack. If we lose here, it's over.Our lives are in your hands. We're counting on you.Ready?
	Cid- Wait- Okay, ready- Hear more

<sp> Once the party agrees to fight... </sp>
<sp> ManThis is the deciding battle. The enemy numbers more than ever before. </sp>
<sp> A lengthy battle with Shinra troops ensues. </sp>

<sp> If Cid and the others defeat the Shinra... </sp>
	ManYES! We did it! That was wonderful! Thank you!! I doubt Shinra will attack now.
	He laughs, then looks outside.
	A, arrgghh......
	Outside, the condor's egg begins to crack, there is a blaze of light, and the condor falls from atop the reactor. The egg hatches.
	ManTh, that light just now......The condor......The eggs......What!?Would you go outside and see what it was?
	Cid goes outside to investigate. He picks up the Phoenix materia and watches the hatchling condor fly off. Cid goes back inside.
	ManGone...Be sure and report to my father, too.Oh, it's you. Thanks a lot.
	Cid goes down to report to the father.
	Man with HatEveryone, thanks. I really mean it. Thanks.Although there isn't anything we can give you, we'll make sure you can stop in and stay any time, so be sure to drop by.Yes, yes, and there's one thing I forgot to tell you......
	Received key item "Huge Materia"!
	CidHuh? What's this?
	
		BarretDamn man, it's Huge Materia.
		YuffieGotta have that materia!
		Cait SithHmm, you mean this?
		VincentThis is......
	
	Man with HatThe truth is, this is the materia inside the reactor.
	CidWhat the hell did we fight for?
	Man with HatWe weren't protectin' the reactor, we were protectin' the condors.When that reactor was built, they forced us to help. That's how we knew what was inside the reactor.I knew this day would come, so after the Shinra left, I sneaked in and took the materia.I didn't mean to fool you, but I guess that's how it ended up. I'm really sorry.
	CidJust forget about it. Anyway, we're still alive.
	Man with HatI see. If you put it that way...... we're really grateful.
	CidSo the last Huge Materia that Shinra's after's in the underwater reactor in Junon?
	
		BarretWe gotta get there first and beat 'em no matter what!
		NanakiWe must get there before them and stop them!
		YuffieWe gotta get there and stop 'em...
		VincentGetting to the reactor before them...
	
	CidBut ya know, Shinra's probably on high alert since we always mess with 'em.How 'bout we take a break and go see that little fella for a bit?
	
		BarretYou mus' mean Cloud......
		NanakiYou mean, Cloud...?
		YuffieCloud, right...?
		Cait SithYou must mean Mr. Cloud......
	
	CidYeah, I'm worried 'bout Tifa; she may've collapsed takin' care of the guy.How 'bout checkin' in on 'em! Down to Mideel!


<sp> If the party loses the battle... </sp>
	Cid comes back inside the shack and falls over.
	Man...... Even if you could only spare them......
	The party comes to at the bottom of Fort Condor and slowly gets up.
	CidGod! What the hell happened here!?
	
		BarretHe's still alive.
		NanakiWhere are we?
		YuffieOh good, they're still alive.
		Cait SithOy! What on earth happened?
		VincentSeems like we survived.
	
	CidDamn!! I can't stand this!
	
		BarretOh man...... You look like hell.
		Nanaki......not enough strength.
		YuffieWell, I'm just glad we're all alive.
		Cait SithThings sure don't go smoothly.
		VincentWe might have understimated the situation.
	
	CidThis ain't no joke, Jack.
	
		BarretOh man, this is real bad.
		NanakiThings don't seem too favorable.
		YuffieI told you I'm not kidding!
		Cait SithIt'd be one thing if it was a joke, but this's the truth.
		VincentThis is a rather harsh reality.
	
	CidIt's Huge Materia that the Shinra's after...... The only one left is in the underwater reactor in Junon.
	
		BarretWe gotta get there first and protect it!!
		NanakiWe must get there first and stop them.
		YuffieWe got to get there first and stop them......
		VincentWe've got to get there first and stop them.
	
	CidYeah, but ever since we got in their way the last time, they should've gotten a little more cautious.I doubt they'll fly right into action. I'm more concerned about him that anything else.
	
		BarretCloud, it's you......
		NanakiYes, it's you Cloud......
		YuffieIt is you Cloud......
		Cait SithCloud......
		VincentCloud, it's you......
	
	CidYeah, and I'm worried that even Tifa's gonna fall over on her butt.Let's go back and see what's happening?...... to Mideel...
	The others nod.
