<sp> A Public Execution </sp>
<sp> Shinra Fights Weapon </sp>
<sp> Tifa's Escape </sp>
<sp> Not Enough Crew </sp>

<sp> The screen is pitch black. Cloud sits in the distance. </sp>
<sp> TifaCloud...Cloud... </sp>
<sp> Cloud gets up and starts walking away. Tifa runs after him. </sp>
<sp> Tifa......I didn't know what to do. I was always like that... </sp>
<sp> Flashback to the Sector 7 train station, before the events of the game. Cloud is lying near the steps and the train man and a dog are nearby. </sp>
<sp> Station ManWhat's the matter? </sp>
<sp> Cloudohhh... </sp>
<sp> Station Man......poor kid. </sp>
<sp> CloudOoouugh...... </sp>
<sp> Tifa runs over. </sp>
<sp> TifaAre you all right? </sp>
<sp> Cloudoo... uh... agh </sp>
<sp> Flash. </sp>
<sp> Uh... uh... Tifa...?Tifa...? </sp>
<sp> He gets to his feet. </sp>
<sp> Tifa! </sp>
<sp> Tifa...............?Oh, Cloud! </sp>
<sp> CloudThat's right. I'm Cloud. </sp>
<sp> TifaIs it really you, Cloud? I never thought I'd find you here! </sp>
<sp> CloudYeah, it's been a while. </sp>
<sp> TifaWhat happened to you? You don't look well. </sp>
<sp> Cloud......Yeah? It's nothing. I'm okay. </sp>
<sp> She turns away and he clutches his head for a moment. She turns back. </sp>
<sp> TifaHow long has it been? </sp>
<sp> Flash. </sp>
<sp> CloudFive years. </sp>
<sp> Tifa............ </sp>
<sp> CloudWhat is it? </sp>
<sp> Tifa...it's really been a long time. </sp>
<sp> TifaActually, it's been seven years.You got your wish and joined SOLDIER, quit after the Sephiroth incident, and now you're a mercenary...You told me a lot about what happened after you left Nibelheim...But......Something's wrong. I felt there was something strange about the things you talked about.All the things you didn't know that you should, And other things you shouldn't know that you did...I wanted to make sure...But then I heard... you were going far away...And I didn't want that......I didn't know what to do. So, I thought I needed more time.And that's why I told you about the AVALANCHE job. I wanted to be with you, watch you. </sp>
<sp> Tifa wakes in Junon base to bright lights overhead. </sp>
<sp> Tifa...ding...... </sp>
<sp> BarretHuh? </sp>
<sp> TifaThe glare... </sp>
<sp> BarretYou'll be better soon. You've been asleep for a long time. </sp>
<sp> TifaI'm...... hungry.... </sp>
<sp> BarretHey, why don't you ask? </sp>
<sp> About him. </sp>
<sp> The glare fades and Tifa sits up. </sp>
<sp> Tifa...Because I'm scared. </sp>
<sp> BarretDon't worry. I don't know what happened to Cloud either.Guess I shouldn't tell you not to worry...None of them know if he's all right either. </sp>
<sp> TifaHe's still... alive, right? </sp>
<sp> Barret nods. </sp>
<sp> TifaHow long... was I asleep? </sp>
<sp> BarretLessee now...... Must've been about 7 days. </sp>
<sp> TifaWhat about Sephiroth? </sp>
<sp> BarretYou ain't over it yet. Remember that huge light, in the Northern Cave?Since then, the crater's been surrounded by a huge barrier of light.Everyone knows Sephiroth sleeps in that big hole, protected by the barrier.We can't do a damn thing about it. We just gotta wait till he wakes up.An' on topa that, some huge monster called Weapon's been on a rampage. </sp>
<sp> Tifa...Weapon? </sp>
<sp> BarretRemember that huge monster that was with Sephiroth, at the bottom of the crater?Well it's up here now. They say it's some legendary monster from the past. </sp>
<sp> TifaWeapon... is protecting Sephiroth? </sp>
<sp> BarretDunno. But he's up here goin' around tearin' shit up.Right now Rufus' fightin' it. I hate to say it, but he's got guts.We shoulda been the ones to destroy it, but we ain't got no time... </sp>
<sp> TifaTime......Hey! How about Meteor? </sp>
<sp> Barret opens the blinds to a large window as Tifa walks to look outside. Meteor hangs there in the sky. </sp>
<sp> TifaDo we have to give up? </sp>
<sp> Barret...Dunno. </sp>
<sp> The door opens and Rufus enters. </sp>
<sp> RufusI thought Cloud would show up to save you all...Professor Hojo wanted to check up on Cloud, too. </sp>
<sp> TifaWhat are you going to do to Cloud? </sp>
<sp> RufusSephiroth's alter ego...Meteor has been summoned... Essentially, it's all but over now.So, there's no need for you now.No, maybe there is an important task for you... </sp>
<sp> Heidegger enters. </sp>
<sp> HeideggerPresident! Preparations for the public execution are complete. </sp>
<sp> BarretExecution!?What're ya gonna get by executin' us? </sp>
<sp> RufusYou are to be executed for causing this situation.People are ignorant. They'll feel better as long as someone is punished. </sp>
<sp> BarretI take back what little praise I had for this damn jackass! </sp>
<sp> RufusWell, enjoy your last moments together. </sp>
<sp> He walks out. </sp>
<sp> HeideggerI'll tie your arms now. </sp>
<sp> Barret and Tifa are escorted down to the press room, where Scarlet waits with the media. </sp>
<sp> ScarletIs everyone here? These are the ones who brought this madness into the world! </sp>
<sp> BarretThe hell are these people? </sp>
<sp> ScarletWe will be broadcasting your miserable deaths live on national television. </sp>
<sp> Large ManScarlet, why a public execution in this day and age? </sp>
<sp> ScarletWith the chaos resulting from the Meteor reports, we desperately need to rally public support... it's better that we punish somebody, anybody. </sp>
<sp> TifaYou make me sick... </sp>
<sp> Scarletha, ha, ha, ha!They'll never admit it, but everyone loves this stuff!We'll start with this girl. </sp>
<sp> BarretIf you've gotta do it... do me first! </sp>
<sp> ScarletCamera, this way! Make sure you get this, the audience just eats up tearful goodbyes! </sp>
<sp> A soldier brings Tifa into the gas chamber, and Scarlet pushes her towards the chair. </sp>
<sp> TifaWhat are you doing!? </sp>
<sp> ScarletThis is my special gas chamber. Take your time, and enjoy a slow painful death. </sp>
<sp> She shoves Tifa into the chair. </sp>
<sp> Stuck up ^%$#&amp;!! </sp>
<sp> She slaps Tifa. </sp>
<sp> Scarlet and the soldier walk out, the soldier dropping a key on the way. </sp>
<sp> ScarletWell now, the show's about to begin. Ha, ha, ha! </sp>
<sp> Emergency! Emergency!Weapon's approaching! Attention all military personnel: take your positions! </sp>
<sp> Press RepresentativesOh no! It's Weapon!Run! </sp>
<sp> They all flee the press room except for the large man. </sp>
<sp> ScarletHey, hey, all of you!Damn! Why now? </sp>
<sp> Large ManHow does it feel now, Scarlet? </sp>
<sp> ScarletHmm, so you didn't run? I'm impressed. How do I feel? Right now......Nngaaaaaahhhh! </sp>
<sp> She collapses. </sp>
<sp> BarretHuh!? Sleeping gas? </sp>
<sp> The large man reveals himself to be Cait Sith in disguise. </sp>
<sp> SoldiersWeirdo!! </sp>
<sp> Cait Sith and Barret dispatch the soldiers. </sp>
<sp> Cait Sith (untying Barret's arms)I'm here to help! </sp>
<sp> BarretWhy you......? Ain't you part of Shinra? </sp>
<sp> Cait SithLet's just say I'm against capital punishment. Besides... I hate this broad. Come on, we gotta help Tifa.I'll keep watch at the entrance. </sp>
<sp> Scarlet......Fools...... I've already pushed... the switch... </sp>
<sp> Barret tugs at the door to the gas chamber. </sp>
<sp> BarretIt won't open! </sp>

<sp> Meanwhile, in the command room, Rufus and Heidegger stand before a broad window overlooking the ocean. </sp>
<sp> HeideggerIt's Weapon. </sp>
<sp> RufusThere's been so many attacks lately. Can we handle it? </sp>
<sp> HeideggerI believe so. Your orders? </sp>
<sp> RufusNo need to ask. </sp>
<sp> HeideggerWe'll give it a shot from our big cannon.Open cannon doors!! Activate cannon. Target: Weapon!! </sp>
<sp> SailorPreparations complete! </sp>
<sp> HeideggerThe cannon...Fire----!!! </sp>
<sp> The cannon fires a shot across the water. A moment of silence descends. </sp>
<sp> RufusDid we get 'em? </sp>
<sp> HeideggerSeems so... </sp>
<sp> Weapon approaching!Speed, 50 Knots!It's heading right toward us! </sp>
<sp> HeideggerIt can't be! We hit it dead on! </sp>
<sp> RufusHow about the cannon? </sp>
<sp> HeideggerIt'll take time to reload. </sp>
<sp> RufusThen use regular fire power in the mean time! </sp>
<sp> HeideggerYes sir! Open all artillery doors! Target: Weapon! Don't let it land! </sp>
<sp> Speed, 70 Knots!Weapon, closing in!!Not good! It's attacking! </sp>

<sp> Back at the gas chamber, the gas turns on and Tifa starts squirming. </sp>
<sp> TifaGas!!Barret, help!! </sp>
<sp> BarretHold your breath! Hold on as long as you can! </sp>
<sp> TifaCome on! I can't hold on forever! </sp>
<sp> BarretShi-!The Gas Room's probably locked from a different room! </sp>
<sp> Cait SithHmm, we gotta go with a different plan. Let's get out of this room first. </sp>
<sp> BarretTifa! I'll help you, I promise! </sp>
<sp> They leave the press room, and the door locks behind them. </sp>
<sp> BarretNo! They locked this too! </sp>
<sp> Scarlet (from inside)Fools. Now, you can't save the girl.Ha, ha, ha, ha!! </sp>
<sp> BarretGoddammit......!! </sp>
<sp> Cait SithOK, OK time for Plan B. Let's run to the airport! </sp>
<sp> BarretWhy the airport? An' leave Tifa there? </sp>
<sp> Cait SithTrust me, trust me. We gotta take a chance. </sp>
<sp> If Barret goes the wrong way... </sp>
<sp> Cait SithWhere you goin'? The airport's the other way. </sp>
<sp> They run outside and run across Yuffie dressed as a reporter. </sp>
<sp> YuffieI know you're in a hurry! But, please if I could have a word...... </sp>
<sp> BarretShu'up!! I'm in a hurry! </sp>
<sp> Kiiiiin... </sp>
<sp> YuffieDon't make so much noise...... It's me, ME! Yuffie! </sp>
<sp> BarretThe hell you doin' here!? </sp>
<sp> YuffieI'll explain later! Now we gotta get to the airport! </sp>
<sp> They arrive at the airport. </sp>
<sp> BarretYo! You sure this is the right way? It's a dead end! </sp>
<sp> Cait SithUh oh? Did I make a wrong turn? </sp>
<sp> BarretYou damn cat......! What the hell're we gonna do now? They all be comin' soon!Yo, better watch my back till the end... partner! </sp>

<sp> Back in the gas chamber, Tifa manages to grab the dropped key with her feet and free herself from the chair. </sp>
<sp> TifaWhich button stops the gas...? </sp>
<sp> She turns off the gas and then tries to tug open the door. </sp>
<sp> Open it---...... </sp>
<sp> There is an explosion as Weapon blasts a hole in the ceiling above her. </sp>
<sp> ScarletWhat d'you do? Hey! Open it! </sp>
<sp> TifaFirst you lock me in this weird place, and now you're telling me to come out? Make up your mind! </sp>
<sp> She climbs out the opening, down the outside of the base, and runs out across the cannon. Scarlet follows and they face off near the end of the cannon. </sp>
<sp> ScarletOur little game of hide and seek ends here.The execution may have been unsuccessful, but your death by falling from here and crashing into the water below still might be pretty exciting. </sp>
<sp> Slap. </sp>
<sp> Stuck up to the end! </sp>
<sp> TifaQuit slapping me! You old wench!!! </sp>
<sp> A slapping fight ensues, and Scarlet falls to her knees. </sp>
<sp> ScarletGod! I can't stand it!Take her away.Now it's time to pay up. I'll really drop you if you don't settle down!Ha, ha, ha, ha! </sp>
<sp> Run...Run to the end of the Cannon!! </sp>
<sp> Tifa runs to the end of the cannon as the airship, the Highwind, comes up from below and hovers nearby. Barret is out on deck, and he throws Tifa a rope. She jumps from the cannon and catches the rope as the Highwind flies away from Junon. </sp>
<sp> BarretYou okay? </sp>
<sp> TifaMy cheeks hurt a bid.Forget about that, what's all this about? </sp>
<sp> Cait SithWell, I'll catch the details later.In any case, the Airship, Highwind, is now yours. </sp>
<sp> Yuffie (lying on deck)Ha! Ha! ......urk!Well...... I'm glad you're safe.I'm going to stay up here a little longer.......Urk! ......I can't ride ships either in the air or water. </sp>
<sp> Tifa goes inside. </sp>
<sp> Crew MemberMy hands are full, so I'll excuse myself here! </sp>
<sp> Tifa- Fly Airship- Chew the fat </sp>

  Fly Airship
  Crew MemberSo things have come to this... When you want to take off, just tell the pilot on the bridge.


  Chew the fat
  Crew Member......Well......... Um, what should I talk about?Wanna hear why we rebelled?Working on the Highwind, we spent every day slaving under Heidegger.Whenever he got yelled at by the President, he'd immediately take it out on the crew.We put up with this all the time. Even when he beat us.I mean, I finally made it on the crew of the famous Highwind, and there's no way I was going to quit over him.Let's see, it must've been a week ago... it was my shift and we were heading towards the North Cave.Everyone, including the President and Scarlet, got on.And with them, I saw Cid, a legendary pilot!And he was looking around the inside of the ship looking really, y'know, nostalgic......He even talked to us.I couldn't believe it! I was so impressed! He was every bit as warmhearted as we'd always heard.Cid said that if he had the Highwind, things would be a lot easier.And now here we are off to save the planet. It's true. He really overwhelmed me.And that's why we decided to help.After the North Cave, we went to Junon, and I started screaming 'Fire! Fire!'In the middle of all the commotion, we stole this ship from the Shinra.That's how it happened. .......Just a minor mutiny against our leaders.But Barret and you were captured by Heidegger......We waited seven days for a chance to rescue you guys, before we finally could.So thanks to our successful mission, we were able to see you again.I hope I didn't bore you too much with that long story.

<sp> BarretDammit! Why didn't ya tell me you could fly an airship!?I thought...... Tifa was gone for good. </sp>
<sp> Cait SithSorry, but I had to do something to trick the enemy.Come on! Everyone is waiting! </sp>
<sp> TifaEveryone? Everyone's here? </sp>
<sp> Tifa runs to the bridge. </sp>
<sp> CidWelcome to my airship--the Highwind! </sp>
<sp> Tifa looks around. </sp>
<sp> CidWhat's wrong!? You should be more excited than that! </sp>
<sp> NanakiCid...... </sp>
<sp> CidYeah...... </sp>
<sp> TifaNot enough crew. </sp>
<sp> BarretWhat's that sad face for? </sp>
<sp> CidWell, it takes all kinds. </sp>
<sp> NanakiDo you think we aren't strong enough without Cloud?Do you think we can't save the Planet alone? </sp>
<sp> TifaMeteor is coming, and Weapon is on the rampage......At a time like this, I don't know what I'm supposed to do......No idea at all...... </sp>
<sp> BarretGet a hold of yourself Tifa! C'mon, let's think about this!No way we can get offa this train we're on! </sp>
<sp> Tifa......If only Cloud was here, everything would be fine.Cloud would......Stand that cocky little way he did, and tell us what to do.He'd say, 'Everything's under control, Tifa.' </sp>
<sp> BarretTifa! When'd you become such a wimp! </sp>
<sp> TifaI'm sorry Barret.I'm kind of shocked myself. I'm so depressed. </sp>
<sp> NanakiAnd Tifa...... the reason why we all thought it was Cloud was because...... </sp>
<sp> Tifa......I know.That's why I want to make sure. That's why I have to see him again. </sp>
<sp> NanakiCheer up, Tifa...... </sp>
<sp> Vincent......So glad you're all right Tifa. </sp>
<sp> BarretWhat? Does Cloud always gotta be around?.......We did fine without him in the beginning......Right? An' what happened to tough girl I used to know? Where'd she go to? </sp>
<sp> Cait SithTifa, I'll give you information Shinra.Ask me if there's anything you don't understand. </sp>
<sp> Crew Member 2Whenever anyone talks to me, I get all nervous and mess things up! </sp>
<sp> CidHey you! What the hell are you doin'!? </sp>
<sp> Crew Member 3All we have to do is just pilot. They don't have to talk to us. </sp>
<sp> CidI want you to know that I didn't dislike him.Gotta admit he was a strange dude.Just when you thought he was cool, he'd go and do some damn fool thing.And when you thought he was smart, he'd show how stupid he was.Everything about him from his movements to his speech were kinda odd.Knowin' what I do now, I can see why he was that way.Well, as long as you stay alive, you just might see him again someday, so cheer up, sis. </sp>
<sp> Tifa......I'll be able to see him someday. </sp>
<sp> CidIf we can find out where he is, the Highwind'll get us there in no time. </sp>
<sp> Nanaki......MaybeCloud is still stuck deep in the North Crater, where the ground cracked and swallowed him up......Buried in the depths of the underground...... </sp>
<sp> TifaDeep within the earth...... are you talking about the Lifestream? </sp>
<sp> NanakiThe Lifestream sometimes gushes out the the surface from cracks in the ocean floor.I've heard that such a place exists.Maybe, just maybe Cloud's...... </sp>
<sp> Pilot in Training (LV3)Waaaaah! Captain Cid! </sp>
<sp> CidTifa, sorry, but I've gotta show this moron how to land the ship.Don't worry, it'll be done in a minute.Oh, and Tifa......No matter what your goal is, you've got to be prepared.Go to your room and get ready for our operation.I put a lot of things for the operation in your room, so put them in order. </sp>
<sp> Tifa goes to the Operations Room. </sp>
<sp> Crew Member 4Tifa, thank you for a job well done! </sp>
<sp> Back on the bridge... </sp>
<sp> BarretWhenever I think of Cloud, everything gets all jumbled up.No matter how powerful Shinra or Hojo is, I can't believe they can create humans.But because of them, we know that Meteor is heading towards us......Y'know, even if I saw him, I don't have a damn idea what I'd do...... </sp>
<sp> NanakiThere appears to be a small island near the Lifestream......They said the Lifestream sometimes suddenly gushes out at the south island.I remember hearing about this from Seto when I was a child, but I don't remember much else......I'm sorry...... Tifa. </sp>
<sp> Cait SithEverything appears calm right now at Shinra.So now's the time to look for Cloud.I'm worried about him, too.I wonder where Cloud is. Or could he already be...... </sp>
<sp> VincentToo much hope is the opposite of despair.An overpowering love may consume you in the end...... </sp>
<sp> CidOK! You just signal when you're ready to fly full speed. </sp>
<sp> Pilot in Training (LV4)Eaggggh! Are we going? </sp>
<sp> Tifa- We're going- We're staying put </sp>
<sp> Pilot in Training (LV4)Eagggggh! We're off! </sp>
