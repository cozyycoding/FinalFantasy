Exploring Icicle Inn
Gast's House
A Run-in with Elena

<stage>After crossing the snow fields, Cloud and the others reach Icicle Inn.</stage>
<speaker name="Girls Building a Snowman">Girls Building a Snowman</speaker><boxstart/>It's almost finished!<boxstart/>Next time, I'm gonna make an even bigger one.
<stage>In the Weapons Shop...</stage>
<speaker name="Little Girl">Little Girl</speaker><boxstart/>Grandpa, wake up! We have a customer!!
<speaker name="Old Man">Old Man</speaker><boxstart/>...smack... mff... Oh... welcome, glad you came.
<stage>Inside the large house...</stage>
<speaker name="Old Woman in Rocking Chair">Old Woman in Rocking Chair</speaker><boxstart/>My husband left 20 years ago and still hasn't come back.<boxstart/>He should at least be at the foot of the Gaea Cliffs. It's marked with a check on the map...
<speaker name="Young Woman">Young Woman</speaker><boxstart/>Grandma, don't sleep so close to the fire!
<speaker name="Old Woman">Old Woman</speaker><boxstart/>I just get s-o comfortable.
<speaker name="Young Woman">Young Woman</speaker><boxstart/>The master is an experienced climber, you know.<boxstart/>I've heard that he knows every corner of that Great Glacier!
<speaker name="Man in Yard">Man in Yard</speaker><boxstart/>It's nearly impossible to reach the Northern limits without a map.<boxstart/>If you're thinkin' 'bout going to the Northern limits, you'd better take that map on the wall.
If Cloud has already taken the map...
<boxstart/>What nerve! You already tore down the map.
<stage>Cloud takes the map on the wall and leaves the house. Inside Icicle Inn...</stage>
<speaker name="Black Surfer">Black Surfer</speaker><boxstart/>You heard about the gnarly hill in this town? They tell me it's off limits!
<speaker name="White Surfer">White Surfer</speaker><boxstart/>What luck! We came all this way... crap!
<speaker name="Woman">Woman</speaker><boxstart/>We came from Costa del Sol to snowboard, but we're just about to leave!
<speaker name="Man by Furnace">Man by Furnace</speaker><boxstart/>Phew, what is it? Don't get too close, or it'll burn ya.
<speaker name="Innkeeper">Innkeeper</speaker><boxstart/>It's colder than usual today...<boxstart/>It's 200 gil, you wanna spend the night?
<stage>Inside the inn's bar...</stage>
<speaker name="Woman">Woman</speaker><boxstart/>Welcome! You look like a STRONG one...<boxstart/>If you want, I could lend you an ear...?
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>- Yeah<boxstart/>- Not interested

  <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>Yeah
  <stage>The woman gets up and sits elsewhere.</stage>
  <speaker name="Woman">Woman</speaker><boxstart/>I got bored listening to his stories.
  <speaker name="Man in Overalls">Man in Overalls</speaker><boxstart/>Am I boring you?


  <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>Not interested
  <speaker name="Woman">Woman</speaker><boxstart/>What's with you!? You make me sick!
  <speaker name="Man in Overalls">Man in Overalls</speaker><boxstart/>If you go further North, I heard there's a Huge Crater.<boxstart/>Something huge must've fallen from the sky a long time ago!

<speaker name="Barkeeper">Barkeeper</speaker><boxstart/>I've heard there's a snow woman, at the Great Glacier, that hates hot springs...<boxstart/>But I think it's just a myth to scare off visitors.
<speaker name="Redhead">Redhead</speaker><boxstart/>I heard some guy went to the Great Glacier in the North.<boxstart/>What an idiot. Is he thinkin' 'bout going to that hot spring?
<speaker name="Blond Man">Blond Man</speaker><boxstart/>He's probably gonna get lost in the glacier and freeze to death.<boxstart/>No matter how well equipped he is, out there in that cold on the glacier, I give him two days at the most.
<speaker name="Redhead 2">Redhead 2</speaker><boxstart/>You thinkin' of going North?
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>- That's my plan<boxstart/>- No

  <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>That's my plan
  <speaker name="Redhead 2">Redhead 2</speaker><boxstart/>Well... if you're going past this town you'll need a map.<boxstart/>Maybe there's one left at Mr. Holzoff's house. He used to be a mountain climber.


  <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>No
  <speaker name="Redhead 2">Redhead 2</speaker><boxstart/>Yeah, we really don't have anything here, but make yourself at home.

<speaker name="Man">Man</speaker><boxstart/>Do you know what a Cetra is?
<speaker name="Man 2">Man 2</speaker><boxstart/>What was the Cetra......? Oh yeah, it's the same as the Ancients, right?
<speaker name="Man">Man</speaker><boxstart/>Yeah, a Cetra lived in this town a long time ago.<boxstart/>Her name was Ifalna, and she knew about a lot of things...
<speaker name="Man 2">Man 2</speaker><boxstart/>Whadaya mean?
<speaker name="Man">Man</speaker><boxstart/>I heard she was abducted by the Shinra and was taken somewhere.
<speaker name="Man 2">Man 2</speaker><boxstart/>Shinra and the Ancients... I smell somethin' fishy...
<speaker name="Man in Bathroom">Man in Bathroom</speaker><boxstart/>WHAT'RE YOU LOOKING AT?<boxstart/>You're a real freakazoid, aren't you?
<speaker name="Woman in Bathroom">Woman in Bathroom</speaker> (later)<boxstart/>Eyaaaaaaaaaah!!!
She punches Cloud.
<stage>In exploring the village, Cloud finds a vacant house that once belonged to Professor Gast. There are several videos that Cloud can watch.</stage><boxstart/>

  [The Original Crisis]
  
    <stage>The camera turns on and Gast adjusts the angle to center on Ifalna.</stage>
    <speaker name="Gast">Gast</speaker><boxstart/>Camera's ready!<boxstart/>Then, Ifalna, please tell us about the Cetra.
    <speaker name="Ifalna">Ifalna</speaker><boxstart/>2000 years ago, our ancestors, the Cetra, heard the cries of the Planet.<boxstart/>The first ones to discover the Planet's wound were the Cetra at the Knowlespole.
    <speaker name="Gast">Gast</speaker><boxstart/>Tell us Ifalna... Where is the land called 'Knowlespole'?
    <speaker name="Ifalna">Ifalna</speaker><boxstart/>Knowlespole refers to this area. The Cetra then began a Planet-reading.
    <speaker name="Gast">Gast</speaker><boxstart/>Ifalna, what exactly does Planet-reading entail?
    <speaker name="Ifalna">Ifalna</speaker><boxstart/>...I can't explain it very well, but it's like having a conversation with the Planet...<boxstart/>It said something fell from the sky making a large wound.
    She shakes her head.
    Thousands of Cetra pulled together, trying to heal the Planet...<boxstart/>But, due to the severity of the wound, it was only able to heal itself, over many years.
    <speaker name="Gast">Gast</speaker><boxstart/>Do the Ancients, rather, the Cetra, have special powers to heal the Planet?
    <speaker name="Ifalna">Ifalna</speaker><boxstart/>No, it's not that kind of power. The life force of all living things on this Planet becomes the energy.<boxstart/>The Cetra tried desperately to cultivate the land so as not to diminish the needed energy...
    <speaker name="Gast">Gast</speaker><boxstart/>Hmm, even here so close to the North Cave, the snow never melts.<boxstart/>Is that because the planet's energy is gathered here to heal its injury?
    <stage>Ifalna lowers her head.</stage>
    <speaker name="Ifalna">Ifalna</speaker><boxstart/>Yes, the energy that was needed to heal the Planet withered away the land... then the Planet...<boxstart/>The Planet tried to persuade the Cetra to leave the Knowlespole, but...
    <speaker name="Gast">Gast</speaker><boxstart/>Ifalna... Let's take a break.
    <stage>She turns to him and shakes her head.</stage>
    <speaker name="Ifalna">Ifalna</speaker><boxstart/>I'm all right... When the Cetra... were preparing to part with the land they loved...<boxstart/>That's when it appeared!<boxstart/>It looked like... our... our dead mothers... and our dead brothers. Showing us spectres of their past.
    <speaker name="Gast">Gast</speaker><boxstart/>Who is the person that appeared at the North Cave? I haven't any idea.
    <speaker name="Ifalna">Ifalna</speaker><boxstart/>That's when the one who injured the Planet... or the 'crisis from the sky', as we call him, came.
    She buries her face in her hands.
    He first approached as a friend, deceived them, and finally...... gave them the virus.<boxstart/>The Cetra were attacked by the virus and went mad... transforming into monsters.
    She drops to her knees.
    Then, just as he had at the Knowlespole.<boxstart/>He approached other Cetra clans...... infecting them with... the virus...
    <speaker name="Gast">Gast</speaker><boxstart/>You don't look well... Let's call it a day.
  <boxstart/>
  
  [What is "Weapon?"]
  
    <speaker name="Gast">Gast</speaker><boxstart/>Ifalna, can you comment on the thing called 'Weapon'?
    <speaker name="Ifalna">Ifalna</speaker><boxstart/>Yes, Professor.<boxstart/>The one the Professor mistook for a Cetra... was named Jenova. That is the 'crisis from the sky'.<boxstart/>The Planet knew it had to destroy the 'crisis from the sky'...<boxstart/>You see, as long as Jenova exists, the Planet will never be able to fully heal itself.
    <speaker name="Gast">Gast</speaker><boxstart/>Back then, Weapon was a weapon the Planet produced of it's own will?
    <speaker name="Ifalna">Ifalna</speaker><boxstart/>Yes, but... There is no record of Weapon ever being used.<boxstart/>A small number of the surviving Cetra defeated Jenova, and confined it.<boxstart/>The Planet produced Weapon... But it was no longer necessary to use it.
    <speaker name="Gast">Gast</speaker><boxstart/>So, Weapon no longer exists on this Planet?
    <speaker name="Ifalna">Ifalna</speaker><boxstart/>Weapon cannot vanish. ...it remains asleep somewhere on the Planet.<boxstart/>Even though Jenova is confined, it could come back to life at some time...<boxstart/>The Planet has not fully healed itself yet. It is still, watching Jenova.
    <speaker name="Gast">Gast</speaker><boxstart/>Where is Weapon?
    <stage>Ifalna shakes her head.</stage>
    <speaker name="Ifalna">Ifalna</speaker><boxstart/>I don't know...... I can't hear the voice of the Planet well...<boxstart/>Times... have changed. The Planet... is probably watching this situation closely.
    <stage>She buries her face in her hands. Gast turns away and shakes his head.</stage>
    <speaker name="Gast">Gast</speaker><boxstart/>...Thank you, Ifalna, that will be all for today...
  <boxstart/>
  
  [Confidential -- Daughter's Record: 10th Day after birth]
  
    <speaker name="Ifalna">Ifalna</speaker><boxstart/>What are you doing, Profes...... I mean, honey?
    <speaker name="Gast">Gast</speaker><boxstart/>Oh, I'm thinking of taping it on video. But, the video's not working right...
    <speaker name="Ifalna">Ifalna</speaker><boxstart/>What are you going to tape? Is there still something I haven't mentioned?
    <speaker name="Gast">Gast</speaker><boxstart/>No, that's not it. I'm going to record my beautiful daughter.<boxstart/>And when she's sleeping, her face... looks like an angel.
    <speaker name="Ifalna">Ifalna</speaker><boxstart/>First, we have to figure out her name. We can take the video later!
    <speaker name="Gast">Gast</speaker><boxstart/>I've already decided! If it's a girl, then it'll be Aerith. That's that!
    <speaker name="Ifalna">Ifalna</speaker><boxstart/>You are SO selfish! But Aerith is a good name!<boxstart/>Hee hee... it's a good name, considering it came out of that forgetful head of yours!
    <speaker name="Gast">Gast</speaker><boxstart/>Right!? Oh, the video tape......
  <boxstart/>
  
  [Confidential -- Daughter's Record: 20th Day after birth]
  
    <speaker name="Ifalna">Ifalna</speaker><boxstart/>Video again? You just got through taping!
    <speaker name="Gast">Gast</speaker><boxstart/>.........Please don't say it that way.<boxstart/>It's our lovely daughter, both yours... and mine!<boxstart/>Don't you want to capture her childhood on videotape?
    <speaker name="Ifalna">Ifalna</speaker><boxstart/>If you keep doting on her like that, she won't grow up to be strong...<boxstart/>Aerith is different from the other children. I wonder what dangers await her...?
    <speaker name="Gast">Gast</speaker><boxstart/>Never say that! I will protect you and Aerith no matter what!!<boxstart/>You and Aerith are my only treasures. I'll never let you go!!
    <speaker name="Ifalna">Ifalna</speaker><boxstart/>I feel so much better now, darling.<boxstart/>If I hadn't met you, I......
    <stage>They start to embrace, but there is a knock on the door.</stage>
    <speaker name="Gast">Gast</speaker><boxstart/>Who could that--I was just about to...<boxstart/>Damn!!<boxstart/>How dare they intrude on our 'private time' together!
    <speaker name="Ifalna">Ifalna</speaker><boxstart/>I'll send them away.<boxstart/>Yes, at once!!<boxstart/>Who the devil?
    She goes to the door and opens it.
    It, it's them!!
    <stage>She runs back down the stairs and hides behind Gast. They both back up as two Shinra soldiers enter, followed by Hojo.</stage>
    <speaker name="Hojo">Hojo</speaker><boxstart/>Heh, heh, heh...... I've been searching for you, Ifalna... or should I say, Cetra!<boxstart/>Long time no see, Professor Gast!
    <speaker name="Gast">Gast</speaker><boxstart/>Hojo... How did you know?
    <speaker name="Hojo">Hojo</speaker><boxstart/>Believe me, I had to turn over a stone or two to find you.<boxstart/>Two years I waited... That's how much I wanted this new sample...... Ha, ha, ha.
    <stage>Ifalna buries her face in her hands and Gast shakes his head.</stage>
    <speaker name="Gast">Gast</speaker><boxstart/>...New sample? You don't mean Aerith!?
    <speaker name="Hojo">Hojo</speaker><boxstart/>Hmm, Aerith? What a nice name...... Ha, ha, ha.
    <speaker name="Gast">Gast</speaker><boxstart/>That's it! I'm severing all ties with the Shinra.<boxstart/>Hojo, please leave.
    <stage>Ifalna moves to kneel at Hojo's feet.</stage>
    <speaker name="Ifalna">Ifalna</speaker><boxstart/>Please, Aerith has nothing to do with it! All you want is me, right?
    <speaker name="Gast">Gast</speaker><boxstart/>Ifalna!
    <speaker name="Hojo">Hojo</speaker><boxstart/>I'll need all of you for my experiment.<boxstart/>You understand don't you, Professor Gast? We can change the future of the Planet!
    <stage>Gast kneels down beside Ifalna.</stage>
    <speaker name="Gast">Gast</speaker><boxstart/>Don't worry, Ifalna. I'll take care of this!
    <speaker name="Hojo">Hojo</speaker><boxstart/>Please don't put up a fight. I don't want any harm to come to my precious sample.<boxstart/>Mmm? What a funny looking camera. Guard! Destroy it!
    <stage>One of the soldiers turns to shoot out the camera. The video feed fails.</stage>
    <speaker name="Hojo">Hojo</speaker><boxstart/>Be careful with her!! Ha, ha, ha......
    <speaker name="Ifalna">Ifalna</speaker><boxstart/>Wh... what are you doing, Professor!?
    <speaker name="Gast">Gast</speaker><boxstart/>Ifalna! Take Aerith and run!!
    <stage>There is a gunshot and a thud.</stage>
    <speaker name="Ifalna">Ifalna</speaker><boxstart/>Eyaaaaaah... Darling......!!
    <speaker name="Hojo">Hojo</speaker><boxstart/>Oh, and uh... don't forget the child!<boxstart/>Hmm, a video? The Ancients... Weapon!?<boxstart/>Heh, heh, heh... a mountain of treasure! Thank you Professor... Ha, ha, ha
  

<stage>Having seen everything, Cloud leaves Gast's house and heads for the slopes.</stage>
<speaker name="Man in Thicket">Man in Thicket</speaker><boxstart/>No, don't!! It's a steep downgrade, past here.<boxstart/>It's dangerous, please don't go!
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>- I'm still going<boxstart/>- Thanks for your kindness

  <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>I'm still going
  <speaker name="Man in Thicket">Man in Thicket</speaker><boxstart/>Damn, I was just being nice...<boxstart/>What the? Who are those people over there? Looks like trouble!
  He runs off.


  <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>Thanks for your kindness
  <speaker name="Man in Thicket">Man in Thicket</speaker><boxstart/>No, no. I just did what came natural.<boxstart/>All right, I'm not too busy now. Do you want me to teach you how to ride a snowboard?
  <speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>- Maybe you should<boxstart/>- Not interested
  
    <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>Maybe you should
    <stage>A controls explanation ensues.</stage>
  
  
    <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>Not interested
    <speaker name="Man in Thicket">Man in Thicket</speaker><boxstart/>You're so boring!
  

<stage>When Cloud says he's still going, Elena enters the village, accompanied by Shinra soldiers.</stage>
<speaker name="Elena">Elena</speaker><boxstart/>There they are, hurry!!
<speaker name="Soldiers">Soldiers</speaker><boxstart/>Yes ma'am!!
<stage>Elena and two soldiers run up to Cloud.</stage>
<speaker name="Elena">Elena</speaker><boxstart/>Cloud... huff... wheeze.<boxstart/>I won't let you go any further!
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>What's down there?
<speaker name="Elena">Elena</speaker><boxstart/>It's a SE-CR-ET.<boxstart/>It really doesn't matter! But you really got guts doin' my boss in like that!
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>You mean Boss...... Tseng? That wasn't us. Sephiroth did it.
<speaker name="Elena">Elena</speaker><boxstart/>No! Don't think you can fool me, liar!
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>I'm not lying... it was Sephiroth.
<speaker name="Elena">Elena</speaker><boxstart/>Don't try to act innocent. I'll never forget it!!
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Oh, man...
<speaker name="Elena">Elena</speaker><boxstart/>Looks like talking alone won't cut it. You're going to have to feel some pain!
<speaker name="Soldier">Soldier</speaker><boxstart/>Just you... and me!!
<speaker name="Elena">Elena</speaker><boxstart/>No, I can handle him! There's no way he can avoid my punch.
<speaker name="Soldier">Soldier</speaker><boxstart/>What? Yeah......

  <stage><speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>If Cloud dodges Elena's punch...</stage>
  <stage>Elena goes rolling past him on down the hill, and the soldiers chase after her.</stage>
  <speaker name="Soldier">Soldier</speaker><boxstart/>Ele... Elena!?
  <speaker name="Man in Thicket">Man in Thicket</speaker><boxstart/>What the...? They sure were weak for Shinras.


  <stage><speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>If Cloud doesn't dodge...</stage>
  <stage>Elena punches him, knocking him out cold.</stage>
  <speaker name="Elena">Elena</speaker><boxstart/>Why? Why didn't you try to avoid it...<boxstart/>There's no way they can climb the Great Glacier anyway.<boxstart/>Put them in some house in the village.
  <stage>Cloud wakes in Gast's house.</stage>

<stage>Now, Shinra soldiers stand guarding the town's entrance.</stage>
<speaker name="Soldiers">Soldiers</speaker><boxstart/>This village is now under martial law!
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>- (Do what you're told)<boxstart/>- (Kick his butt)

  <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>(Do what you're told)
  <speaker name="Soldier">Soldier</speaker><boxstart/>Don't be angry. I'm just doing my job.


  <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>(Kick his butt)
  <speaker name="Soldier">Soldier</speaker><boxstart/>Stop it, there're kids around!<boxstart/>Listen, I probably shouldn't tell you, but I hear something big's going down up North.<boxstart/>The President's gonna be there. So, would you please just lay low for a while?

<speaker name="Girl Sledding">Girl Sledding</speaker><boxstart/>Who is that man?
<speaker name="Man on Roof of Small House">Man on Roof of Small House</speaker><boxstart/>When I first moved here, I saw a man with a Black Cape heading North.<boxstart/>It seemed strange seeing a Black Cape against the snowy white.
<stage>Inside the small house...</stage>
<speaker name="Woman">Woman</speaker><boxstart/>My boy got hurt right about the time we moved here...<boxstart/>I never should've bought him a snowboard.
<speaker name="Boy">Boy</speaker><boxstart/>......whimper...... weep...<boxstart/>I got hurt on my snowboard, and now I can't go out for a while...<boxstart/>Hey, I'll give you my snowboard.
Received Key Item "Snowboard"!
<speaker name="Boy">Boy</speaker><boxstart/>Tell me when you get good at it.
<speaker name="Man in Thicket">Man in Thicket</speaker><boxstart/>Sorry I just took off a while ago... It looked like there was going to be trouble.<boxstart/>Anyhow, you'll need a snowboard to get down that hill. Want me to teach you how to ride one?
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>- Yeah, maybe you should<boxstart/>- No, not interested

  <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>Yeah, maybe you should
  <stage>A controls explanation ensues.</stage>


  <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>No, not interested
  <speaker name="Man in Thicket">Man in Thicket</speaker><boxstart/>All right, big-head... But don't blame me if you get hurt.

<stage>Cloud heads off down the slope.</stage>
<speaker name="Man in Thicket">Man in Thicket</speaker><boxstart/>Be careful!
<stage>Cloud and the others snowboard down the slopes, finally flying off an edge and falling down into the Great Glacier.</stage>
