<sp> Exploring Icicle Inn </sp>
<sp> Gast's House </sp>
<sp> A Run-in with Elena </sp>

<sp> After crossing the snow fields, Cloud and the others reach Icicle Inn. </sp>
<sp> Girls Building a SnowmanIt's almost finished!Next time, I'm gonna make an even bigger one. </sp>
<sp> In the Weapons Shop... </sp>
<sp> Little GirlGrandpa, wake up! We have a customer!! </sp>
<sp> Old Man...smack... mff... Oh... welcome, glad you came. </sp>
<sp> Inside the large house... </sp>
<sp> Old Woman in Rocking ChairMy husband left 20 years ago and still hasn't come back.He should at least be at the foot of the Gaea Cliffs. It's marked with a check on the map... </sp>
<sp> Young WomanGrandma, don't sleep so close to the fire! </sp>
<sp> Old WomanI just get s-o comfortable. </sp>
<sp> Young WomanThe master is an experienced climber, you know.I've heard that he knows every corner of that Great Glacier! </sp>
<sp> Man in YardIt's nearly impossible to reach the Northern limits without a map.If you're thinkin' 'bout going to the Northern limits, you'd better take that map on the wall. </sp>
<sp> If Cloud has already taken the map... </sp>
<sp> What nerve! You already tore down the map. </sp>
<sp> Cloud takes the map on the wall and leaves the house. Inside Icicle Inn... </sp>
<sp> Black SurferYou heard about the gnarly hill in this town? They tell me it's off limits! </sp>
<sp> White SurferWhat luck! We came all this way... crap! </sp>
<sp> WomanWe came from Costa del Sol to snowboard, but we're just about to leave! </sp>
<sp> Man by FurnacePhew, what is it? Don't get too close, or it'll burn ya. </sp>
<sp> InnkeeperIt's colder than usual today...It's 200 gil, you wanna spend the night? </sp>
<sp> Inside the inn's bar... </sp>
<sp> WomanWelcome! You look like a STRONG one...If you want, I could lend you an ear...? </sp>
<sp> Cloud- Yeah- Not interested </sp>

  Yeah
  The woman gets up and sits elsewhere.
  WomanI got bored listening to his stories.
  Man in OverallsAm I boring you?


  Not interested
  WomanWhat's with you!? You make me sick!
  Man in OverallsIf you go further North, I heard there's a Huge Crater.Something huge must've fallen from the sky a long time ago!

<sp> BarkeeperI've heard there's a snow woman, at the Great Glacier, that hates hot springs...But I think it's just a myth to scare off visitors. </sp>
<sp> RedheadI heard some guy went to the Great Glacier in the North.What an idiot. Is he thinkin' 'bout going to that hot spring? </sp>
<sp> Blond ManHe's probably gonna get lost in the glacier and freeze to death.No matter how well equipped he is, out there in that cold on the glacier, I give him two days at the most. </sp>
<sp> Redhead 2You thinkin' of going North? </sp>
<sp> Cloud- That's my plan- No </sp>

  That's my plan
  Redhead 2Well... if you're going past this town you'll need a map.Maybe there's one left at Mr. Holzoff's house. He used to be a mountain climber.


  No
  Redhead 2Yeah, we really don't have anything here, but make yourself at home.

<sp> ManDo you know what a Cetra is? </sp>
<sp> Man 2What was the Cetra......? Oh yeah, it's the same as the Ancients, right? </sp>
<sp> ManYeah, a Cetra lived in this town a long time ago.Her name was Ifalna, and she knew about a lot of things... </sp>
<sp> Man 2Whadaya mean? </sp>
<sp> ManI heard she was abducted by the Shinra and was taken somewhere. </sp>
<sp> Man 2Shinra and the Ancients... I smell somethin' fishy... </sp>
<sp> Man in BathroomWHAT'RE YOU LOOKING AT?You're a real freakazoid, aren't you? </sp>
<sp> Woman in Bathroom (later)Eyaaaaaaaaaah!!! </sp>
<sp> She punches Cloud. </sp>
<sp> In exploring the village, Cloud finds a vacant house that once belonged to Professor Gast. There are several videos that Cloud can watch. </sp>

  [The Original Crisis]
  
    The camera turns on and Gast adjusts the angle to center on Ifalna.
    GastCamera's ready!Then, Ifalna, please tell us about the Cetra.
    Ifalna2000 years ago, our ancestors, the Cetra, heard the cries of the Planet.The first ones to discover the Planet's wound were the Cetra at the Knowlespole.
    GastTell us Ifalna... Where is the land called 'Knowlespole'?
    IfalnaKnowlespole refers to this area. The Cetra then began a Planet-reading.
    GastIfalna, what exactly does Planet-reading entail?
    Ifalna...I can't explain it very well, but it's like having a conversation with the Planet...It said something fell from the sky making a large wound.
    She shakes her head.
    Thousands of Cetra pulled together, trying to heal the Planet...But, due to the severity of the wound, it was only able to heal itself, over many years.
    GastDo the Ancients, rather, the Cetra, have special powers to heal the Planet?
    IfalnaNo, it's not that kind of power. The life force of all living things on this Planet becomes the energy.The Cetra tried desperately to cultivate the land so as not to diminish the needed energy...
    GastHmm, even here so close to the North Cave, the snow never melts.Is that because the planet's energy is gathered here to heal its injury?
    Ifalna lowers her head.
    IfalnaYes, the energy that was needed to heal the Planet withered away the land... then the Planet...The Planet tried to persuade the Cetra to leave the Knowlespole, but...
    GastIfalna... Let's take a break.
    She turns to him and shakes her head.
    IfalnaI'm all right... When the Cetra... were preparing to part with the land they loved...That's when it appeared!It looked like... our... our dead mothers... and our dead brothers. Showing us spectres of their past.
    GastWho is the person that appeared at the North Cave? I haven't any idea.
    IfalnaThat's when the one who injured the Planet... or the 'crisis from the sky', as we call him, came.
    She buries her face in her hands.
    He first approached as a friend, deceived them, and finally...... gave them the virus.The Cetra were attacked by the virus and went mad... transforming into monsters.
    She drops to her knees.
    Then, just as he had at the Knowlespole.He approached other Cetra clans...... infecting them with... the virus...
    GastYou don't look well... Let's call it a day.
  
  
  [What is "Weapon?"]
  
    GastIfalna, can you comment on the thing called 'Weapon'?
    IfalnaYes, Professor.The one the Professor mistook for a Cetra... was named Jenova. That is the 'crisis from the sky'.The Planet knew it had to destroy the 'crisis from the sky'...You see, as long as Jenova exists, the Planet will never be able to fully heal itself.
    GastBack then, Weapon was a weapon the Planet produced of it's own will?
    IfalnaYes, but... There is no record of Weapon ever being used.A small number of the surviving Cetra defeated Jenova, and confined it.The Planet produced Weapon... But it was no longer necessary to use it.
    GastSo, Weapon no longer exists on this Planet?
    IfalnaWeapon cannot vanish. ...it remains asleep somewhere on the Planet.Even though Jenova is confined, it could come back to life at some time...The Planet has not fully healed itself yet. It is still, watching Jenova.
    GastWhere is Weapon?
    Ifalna shakes her head.
    IfalnaI don't know...... I can't hear the voice of the Planet well...Times... have changed. The Planet... is probably watching this situation closely.
    She buries her face in her hands. Gast turns away and shakes his head.
    Gast...Thank you, Ifalna, that will be all for today...
  
  
  [Confidential -- Daughter's Record: 10th Day after birth]
  
    IfalnaWhat are you doing, Profes...... I mean, honey?
    GastOh, I'm thinking of taping it on video. But, the video's not working right...
    IfalnaWhat are you going to tape? Is there still something I haven't mentioned?
    GastNo, that's not it. I'm going to record my beautiful daughter.And when she's sleeping, her face... looks like an angel.
    IfalnaFirst, we have to figure out her name. We can take the video later!
    GastI've already decided! If it's a girl, then it'll be Aerith. That's that!
    IfalnaYou are SO selfish! But Aerith is a good name!Hee hee... it's a good name, considering it came out of that forgetful head of yours!
    GastRight!? Oh, the video tape......
  
  
  [Confidential -- Daughter's Record: 20th Day after birth]
  
    IfalnaVideo again? You just got through taping!
    Gast.........Please don't say it that way.It's our lovely daughter, both yours... and mine!Don't you want to capture her childhood on videotape?
    IfalnaIf you keep doting on her like that, she won't grow up to be strong...Aerith is different from the other children. I wonder what dangers await her...?
    GastNever say that! I will protect you and Aerith no matter what!!You and Aerith are my only treasures. I'll never let you go!!
    IfalnaI feel so much better now, darling.If I hadn't met you, I......
    They start to embrace, but there is a knock on the door.
    GastWho could that--I was just about to...Damn!!How dare they intrude on our 'private time' together!
    IfalnaI'll send them away.Yes, at once!!Who the devil?
    She goes to the door and opens it.
    It, it's them!!
    She runs back down the stairs and hides behind Gast. They both back up as two Shinra soldiers enter, followed by Hojo.
    HojoHeh, heh, heh...... I've been searching for you, Ifalna... or should I say, Cetra!Long time no see, Professor Gast!
    GastHojo... How did you know?
    HojoBelieve me, I had to turn over a stone or two to find you.Two years I waited... That's how much I wanted this new sample...... Ha, ha, ha.
    Ifalna buries her face in her hands and Gast shakes his head.
    Gast...New sample? You don't mean Aerith!?
    HojoHmm, Aerith? What a nice name...... Ha, ha, ha.
    GastThat's it! I'm severing all ties with the Shinra.Hojo, please leave.
    Ifalna moves to kneel at Hojo's feet.
    IfalnaPlease, Aerith has nothing to do with it! All you want is me, right?
    GastIfalna!
    HojoI'll need all of you for my experiment.You understand don't you, Professor Gast? We can change the future of the Planet!
    Gast kneels down beside Ifalna.
    GastDon't worry, Ifalna. I'll take care of this!
    HojoPlease don't put up a fight. I don't want any harm to come to my precious sample.Mmm? What a funny looking camera. Guard! Destroy it!
    One of the soldiers turns to shoot out the camera. The video feed fails.
    HojoBe careful with her!! Ha, ha, ha......
    IfalnaWh... what are you doing, Professor!?
    GastIfalna! Take Aerith and run!!
    There is a gunshot and a thud.
    IfalnaEyaaaaaah... Darling......!!
    HojoOh, and uh... don't forget the child!Hmm, a video? The Ancients... Weapon!?Heh, heh, heh... a mountain of treasure! Thank you Professor... Ha, ha, ha
  

<sp> Having seen everything, Cloud leaves Gast's house and heads for the slopes. </sp>
<sp> Man in ThicketNo, don't!! It's a steep downgrade, past here.It's dangerous, please don't go! </sp>
<sp> Cloud- I'm still going- Thanks for your kindness </sp>

  I'm still going
  Man in ThicketDamn, I was just being nice...What the? Who are those people over there? Looks like trouble!
  He runs off.


  Thanks for your kindness
  Man in ThicketNo, no. I just did what came natural.All right, I'm not too busy now. Do you want me to teach you how to ride a snowboard?
  Cloud- Maybe you should- Not interested
  
    Maybe you should
    A controls explanation ensues.
  
  
    Not interested
    Man in ThicketYou're so boring!
  

<sp> When Cloud says he's still going, Elena enters the village, accompanied by Shinra soldiers. </sp>
<sp> ElenaThere they are, hurry!! </sp>
<sp> SoldiersYes ma'am!! </sp>
<sp> Elena and two soldiers run up to Cloud. </sp>
<sp> ElenaCloud... huff... wheeze.I won't let you go any further! </sp>
<sp> CloudWhat's down there? </sp>
<sp> ElenaIt's a SE-CR-ET.It really doesn't matter! But you really got guts doin' my boss in like that! </sp>
<sp> CloudYou mean Boss...... Tseng? That wasn't us. Sephiroth did it. </sp>
<sp> ElenaNo! Don't think you can fool me, liar! </sp>
<sp> CloudI'm not lying... it was Sephiroth. </sp>
<sp> ElenaDon't try to act innocent. I'll never forget it!! </sp>
<sp> CloudOh, man... </sp>
<sp> ElenaLooks like talking alone won't cut it. You're going to have to feel some pain! </sp>
<sp> SoldierJust you... and me!! </sp>
<sp> ElenaNo, I can handle him! There's no way he can avoid my punch. </sp>
<sp> SoldierWhat? Yeah...... </sp>

  If Cloud dodges Elena's punch...
  Elena goes rolling past him on down the hill, and the soldiers chase after her.
  SoldierEle... Elena!?
  Man in ThicketWhat the...? They sure were weak for Shinras.


  If Cloud doesn't dodge...
  Elena punches him, knocking him out cold.
  ElenaWhy? Why didn't you try to avoid it...There's no way they can climb the Great Glacier anyway.Put them in some house in the village.
  Cloud wakes in Gast's house.

<sp> Now, Shinra soldiers stand guarding the town's entrance. </sp>
<sp> SoldiersThis village is now under martial law! </sp>
<sp> Cloud- (Do what you're told)- (Kick his butt) </sp>

  (Do what you're told)
  SoldierDon't be angry. I'm just doing my job.


  (Kick his butt)
  SoldierStop it, there're kids around!Listen, I probably shouldn't tell you, but I hear something big's going down up North.The President's gonna be there. So, would you please just lay low for a while?

<sp> Girl SleddingWho is that man? </sp>
<sp> Man on Roof of Small HouseWhen I first moved here, I saw a man with a Black Cape heading North.It seemed strange seeing a Black Cape against the snowy white. </sp>
<sp> Inside the small house... </sp>
<sp> WomanMy boy got hurt right about the time we moved here...I never should've bought him a snowboard. </sp>
<sp> Boy......whimper...... weep...I got hurt on my snowboard, and now I can't go out for a while...Hey, I'll give you my snowboard. </sp>
<sp> Received Key Item "Snowboard"! </sp>
<sp> BoyTell me when you get good at it. </sp>
<sp> Man in ThicketSorry I just took off a while ago... It looked like there was going to be trouble.Anyhow, you'll need a snowboard to get down that hill. Want me to teach you how to ride one? </sp>
<sp> Cloud- Yeah, maybe you should- No, not interested </sp>

  Yeah, maybe you should
  A controls explanation ensues.


  No, not interested
  Man in ThicketAll right, big-head... But don't blame me if you get hurt.

<sp> Cloud heads off down the slope. </sp>
<sp> Man in ThicketBe careful! </sp>
<sp> Cloud and the others snowboard down the slopes, finally flying off an edge and falling down into the Great Glacier. </sp>
