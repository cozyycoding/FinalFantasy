<sp> Cosmo Canyon - Remembering Aerith </sp>

<sp> Cloud and his party arrive at Cosmo Canyon and go up to see Bugenhagen. </sp>
<sp> BugenhagenHo Ho Hoooo. If you ever are in need of my wisdom, you are always welcome here. </sp>
<sp> CloudYeah, that's why we came. </sp>
<sp> BugenhagenWhat to do? Have you lost your way? When that happens we each have to take a good long look at ourselves.There's always something in the deepest reaches of our hearts.Something buried, or something forgotten.Remember it... Whatever that is, must certainly be what you are all looking for... </sp>
<sp> CloudThat's easy enough to say... But, I can't remember a thing. </sp>
<sp> BugenhagenIt must be there. Look harder! </sp>
<sp> BarretThis ain't no good with just us! Cloud, we gotta get some others in here. </sp>
<sp> Tifa...no good. Cloud, let's have the others come. </sp>
<sp> Nanakinghh... no good. We alone cannot do it. We need to have the others here. </sp>
<sp> YuffieYou expect me to know that? Let the others do it! </sp>
<sp> Cait SithHow about it, Cloud? Shouldn't we have the others come? </sp>
<sp> VincentI don't know, Cloud. I think we should have everyone here. </sp>
<sp> CidAhh, no good. Cloud you call the others in here too! </sp>
<sp> Cloud nods and calls up the others on his PHS. They all gather in the observatory. </sp>
<sp> BugenhagenDo you see it? What is it that you are searching for? </sp>
<sp> Cait SithNope. Not a thing. Naw. Can't come up with a thing. </sp>
<sp> YuffieMe either! I don't get any of this! </sp>
<sp> CloudI remember Aerith a lot.No... not that.You haven't remembered.You haven't forgotten.That's not it...How would you say it... Aerith was right there all along. Right by our side.She was so close, we couldn't see her. What Aerith did... The words she left behind... </sp>
<sp> TifaThat reminds me... I was the same. </sp>
<sp> Nanaki......as was I. </sp>
<sp> BarretMe too... </sp>
<sp> CloudShe said she was the only one who could stop Sephiroth's Meteor. </sp>
<sp> TifaBut Aerith is gone. </sp>
<sp> NanakiIs it impossible for us to carry on... what Aerith tried to accomplish? </sp>
<sp> BarretWe ain't no Ancients, if that's what ya mean. </sp>
<sp> CidWhat, did that girl go off to that place? </sp>
<sp> CloudThat's it!! </sp>
<sp> CidWhat's it? </sp>
<sp> CloudWe don't know about it.What did Aerith know?Why did she face Sephiroth without running away? </sp>
<sp> NanakiI see... She returned there once again, correct? </sp>
<sp> BugenhagenHmmm. Perhaps I'll have you take me there. </sp>
<sp> NanakiYou're going too? </sp>
<sp> BugenhagenWhat's so surprising about that...?Even I want to get out from time to time and see the outside world. I wonder what did it? I haven't felt like this in ages. </sp>
<sp> NanakiIt must be the planet. The planet is calling you! </sp>
<sp> CidYeah, hoo boy, the planet calling... right. </sp>
<sp> He walks out. </sp>
<sp> BugenhagenHo Ho Hoooo. Then let's go. </sp>
<sp> The others all file out. </sp>
<sp> CloudOh yeah, Bugenhagen. I have one more thing I want to ask you.We're carrying around Huge Materia. This is pretty delicate stuff and would like to keep it in a safe place... </sp>
<sp> BugenhagenHo Ho Hoooo. Then we'll put it upstairs. Now, shall we be on our way?I'll teach you how to work the machine. Watch carefully now. You just pull this here... </sp>
<sp> And the machine turns on. </sp>
<sp> Ho Ho Hoooo. Is this what you call Huge Materia...?This is really rare Materia, indeed.Materia this rare is certain to have a special consciousness enclosed in it. </sp>
<sp> Cloud inspects the materia and gets Bahamut ZERO from the blue one. </sp>
<sp> BugenhagenHo Ho Hoooo. Good. Now let's leave.Do you remember how to use the machine down below? If you ever want to see Materia, come here anytime. </sp>
<sp> They then return to the Highwind. </sp>
<sp> BugenhagenHm, hmm, hmm!.......Smells like machinery.I love this smell.Of course, I also love the smell of nature, too......Hm? Is the deck up there?Then I'll be on the deck just passing time.I can feel the workings of the planet in the smell of the wind.I also feel the greatness of man's wisdom and the knowledge in the smell of machinery...Well, bye for now. </sp>
<sp> He floats off to the deck. </sp>
<sp> I wonder where you're taking me? </sp>
<sp> YuffieCloud...... urp...... ugh.You know, I was thinking...... phew...... Why does materia always have something to do with battles or magic?I bet the Ancients must've always been fighting.It must've been... ugh... terrible... </sp>
<sp> BarretAnd Aerith... she's dead.Guess she turned into spiritual energy and returned to the planet, huh?But even if she did, there's no way we'll meet her again... </sp>
<sp> TifaI wonder what Aerith felt... when she was on that altar...? </sp>
<sp> CloudI'm sure she wanted to give her life for the planet... </sp>
<sp> TifaReally? I wonder? I don't think that's it at all.I think she didn't think she would die at all, but that she planned on coming back all along.She always used to talk about the 'Next time'.She talked about the future more than any of us...Although she never talked about it to us she must've had a rough life...I think Aerith looked forward to tomorrow and the future more than anyone......she must've had many many dreams...... </sp>
<sp> NanakiAerith used to pat me on the nose sometimes.I used to hate being treated like a child like that, but I also liked the attention.I wanted to apologize to her for what I did when we first met. </sp>
<sp> Cait SithI went an' told Aerith' Mom about her death.Yes, an' Miss Elmyra was cryin' herself silly... So was little Marlene... </sp>
<sp> VincentCity of the Ancients...The Ancients... after a long time that is probably what others will come to call us...Hmmm... hwa ha ha ha... It's only a matter of time for us. </sp>
<sp> CidAerith...?I wanted to give her a ride in the Highwind...... </sp>
<sp> Learner Pilot (LV11)Okay then, let's go! </sp>
<sp> Cloud- Let's go!- Wait a sec...... </sp>
<sp> Cloud and the others set out for the City of the Ancients. </sp>
<sp> If you speak to some of the villagers while Bugenhagen is with the party... </sp>
<sp> Elder Hargo (in the observatory)I hope great Bugenhagen will take care and not overexert himself.'Ho Ho Hoooo.' I may be light, But I'm not as young as Nanaki.Oops. That will only get you angry. You're just like me. Ho ho ho. </sp>
<sp> Kid in Nanaki's RoomBoth Nanaki and Mr. Bugenhagen are gone... I feel so lonely... </sp>
