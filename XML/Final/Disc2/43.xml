The Sister Ray Fires
Conflicts at Shinra HQ
Descent into Midgar
The End of the Turks
Confronting Hojo

<stage>If, in following Diamond Weapon, the Highwind rams into it...</stage>
<speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>Hey, HEY! What're ya tryin' to do? Break the Highwind? Let's fight on the ground!
<stage>They reach and fight Diamond Weapon some miles outside of Midgar, but cannot defeat it. It turns towards Midgar, leaving them behind.</stage>
<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Wassup, Mr. Monster? What're you lookin' at?
<speaker name="Nanaki">Nanaki</speaker><boxstart/>Something's wrong...
<speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>Doesn't look like it's after us. Something else...
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>No, it's...... feeling something. ......Yeah, it senses murder.
<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>Let's go to the Airship!
<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>OK, can we go now!?
<speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>To my ship!
<stage>The others run out. Cloud's PHS rings.</stage>
<speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>Oh no! Let's hurry out of here!<boxstart/>Something big... I'm talkin' REALLY BIG's comin'!

<stage>Meanwhile at Shinra HQ...</stage>
<speaker name="Heidegger">Heidegger</speaker><boxstart/>Hah, hah, hah, Mr. President, preparations for Sister Ray are now in order.
<speaker name="Scarlet">Scarlet</speaker><boxstart/>Hah, hah, hah!<boxstart/>Anytime is fine.
<speaker name="Rufus">Rufus</speaker> (laughing)<boxstart/>......Fire.

<stage>The Sister Ray fires a shot northward. The glass on the Shinra building shatters. Diamond Weapon fires back at Midgar. On the Highwind's deck...</stage>
<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>Which direction is it going to attack from?
<speaker name="Nanaki">Nanaki</speaker><boxstart/>Midgar!
<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Marlene!!
<stage>The shot from the Sister Ray goes right through Diamond Weapon as the Highwind flies by. The Weapon falls.</stage>
<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Damn...
<speaker name="Nanaki">Nanaki</speaker><boxstart/>It went right through Weapon......
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>I see! They're after Sephiroth! The crater on the Northern boundary!

<stage>The shot continues on to the Northern Crater and destroys the barrier. Back at Shinra HQ...</stage>
<speaker name="(operator)">(operator)</speaker><boxstart/>Sir! Weapon's been defeated!!<boxstart/>The barrier has disappeared!
There is a pause.
Sir! A mass of high density energy is heading towards Midgar!
<stage>Rufus turns and looks. In the street below, people are running away from the Shinra building.</stage>
<speaker name="People Fleeing">People Fleeing</speaker><boxstart/>WHOOA-- Weapon's coming!<boxstart/>Run for your lives!!
<stage>Rufus stands motionless in his office as the blast hits.</stage>

<stage>Back on the Highwind...</stage>
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>What happened to...... Sephiroth?<boxstart/>Northern Cave...<boxstart/>Let's go see what happened to it.
<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>When AVALANCHE was jes startin', we used to put up flyers everywhere.<boxstart/>And now, we're up against Sephiroth. How about that?<boxstart/>Feels like a long time ago.
<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>Now we're going to fight Sephiroth.<boxstart/>I wonder what the inside of that cave looks like? You think Sephiroth is just sitting there waiting for Meteor?
<speaker name="Nanaki">Nanaki</speaker><boxstart/>Will we save the world if we beat Sephiroth?<boxstart/>I'm frightened, but I'll do my best. Let's hurry to the Northern Cave!
<speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>......Wonder what that Sephiroth feller's up to?
<speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>Defeat Sephiroth... Defeat the son of that beloved woman...<boxstart/>Am I on the verge of committing another sin......?<boxstart/>Or am I atoning as best I can for only watching...?
<speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>Maybe this is the time?
<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>What's the pilot like?<boxstart/>Tell him Yuffie says if he pilots the plane smoothly, give him my autograph...
<speaker name="Learner Pilot (L14)">Learner Pilot (L14)</speaker><boxstart/>Hey, Cloud!!!
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>- Y, yeah, let's go!<boxstart/>- U, uh wait
<stage>They fly to the Northern Crater.</stage>
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Sephiroth's energy barrier is gone......<boxstart/>Cid! Can the Airship get inside?
<speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>Huh? He's my student, ain't he!? Of course he can go anywhere!
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Right, sorry about that.
<stage>Cait Sith gives a sudden start.</stage>
<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Yo, Cait Sith! Now what?
<speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>Hold it!<boxstart/>Scarlet! Heidegger! What's going on?

<stage>Back at Shinra HQ...</stage>
<speaker name="Heidegger">Heidegger</speaker><boxstart/>Strange. I can't reach the President!
<speaker name="Reeve">Reeve</speaker><boxstart/>Not the President. To Sister Ray!
<speaker name="Scarlet">Scarlet</speaker><boxstart/>Ha, ha, ha. What is it Reeve? You're speaking strangely.
<speaker name="Reeve">Reeve</speaker><boxstart/>None of that matters!<boxstart/>The reactor's output is increasing all by itself!
<speaker name="Scarlet">Scarlet</speaker><boxstart/>Ww, wait a minute. That's not wise!<boxstart/>It must cool for 3 hours or it won't work. Reeve, shut off the machine!
<speaker name="Reeve">Reeve</speaker><boxstart/>We can't do that! It's inoperable!
He pulls out his cell phone.
Someone has switched the machine over to mainframe operation!<boxstart/>We can't operate it from here.
<speaker name="Reeve">Reeve</speaker><boxstart/>What about the mainframe? Who!?
He turns to Heidegger.
<boxstart/>Hey, call the mainframe!
<speaker name="Heidegger">Heidegger</speaker><boxstart/>Huh? Why are you giving orders?
<speaker name="Reeve">Reeve</speaker><boxstart/>I don't give a damn about the details!!

<stage>At the Sister Ray's controls...</stage>
<speaker name="Hojo">Hojo</speaker><boxstart/>Ha, ha, ha...... Just you wait, Sephiroth.<boxstart/>I'll give you all the Mako you want.
<speaker name="Reeve">Reeve</speaker><boxstart/>Hojo, STOP! The cannon, no, Midgar itself is in danger!
<speaker name="Hojo">Hojo</speaker><boxstart/>Ha, ha, ha...... One or two Midgars? ...it's a small price to pay.
<speaker name="Reeve">Reeve</speaker><boxstart/>Hojo! HOJO......!!
<speaker name="Hojo">Hojo</speaker><boxstart/>Show me...... Sephiroth.<boxstart/>It should be near...<boxstart/>Ha, ha, ha...... Go beyond the powers of science...<boxstart/>Before your presence, science is powerless...<boxstart/>I hate it, but I'll concede to it.<boxstart/>Just... let me see it.<boxstart/>Ha, ha, ha......

<stage>Back on the Highwind...</stage>
<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>YO! Do somethin'! Ya big cat!
<speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>We're sunk. Hojo's doing this on his own......<boxstart/>...? ...? H, huh!?<boxstart/>I don't like this......
<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>You're busted, Reeve!<boxstart/>Too late tryin' to hide it now...
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Can't you stop the Mako reactor?
<speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>......We can't stop it.
<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>You're from Shinra, ain't ya? So why's it impossible!?
<speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>............
<speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>We came a long way to get here. You better not double-cross us now!
<speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>I can't make you trust me......
<speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>You damn fool! Don't you understand anything I'm saying?<boxstart/>I don't give a damn about Shinra. If you're a man... no, if you're a human being, you'll save the planet! Don't you even care?
<speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>No way! If we shut down the reactor, all hell will break loose!!
<speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>Why? Can't you just shut off the valve?
<speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>Yeah, it's easy to shut off the reactor's pipe valves......<boxstart/>But the reactor made a path for the energy to escape from below.<boxstart/>Once you open that, it'll be impossible to close it until everything blasts out...<boxstart/>And we can't try to stop the energy from gushing out......
<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>An explosion!!
<speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>This blast'll be way stronger than when the number 1 reactor blew up!
<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Damn...!
<speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>Forget about that......... the CANNON! We've got to get to Midgar! That's the first thing!!
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Must stop Hojo... first.

<stage>At Shinra HQ...</stage>
<speaker name="Reeve">Reeve</speaker><boxstart/>Looks like Cloud and the others are on their way. Stay out of the way!
<speaker name="Heidegger">Heidegger</speaker><boxstart/>Ghaa haah hah hah!<boxstart/>Don't be so ludicrous! I don't recall you giving me any orders!<boxstart/>The Peace Preservation will give their best effort to make the enemy retreat!<boxstart/>Because of them, I...... I...!
<speaker name="Reeve">Reeve</speaker><boxstart/>That's a private matter......
<speaker name="Heidegger">Heidegger</speaker><boxstart/>The President is dead! Now I'm doing things my way!<boxstart/>Ghaa haah hah hah!
<speaker name="Scarlet">Scarlet</speaker><boxstart/>Ha, ha, ha.<boxstart/>Heidegger! Now I'm going to use the new weapon!
<stage>Two Shinra soldiers run in to restrain Reeve. Scarlet and Heidegger leave the Conference Room.</stage>
<speaker name="Reeve">Reeve</speaker><boxstart/>Hey! Wait!!<boxstart/>Cloud, everybody! Sorry......<boxstart/>But!!

<stage>Back on the Highwind...</stage>
<speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>But!<boxstart/>But you'll come, won't you!?
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>I know!
<speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>Hey!<boxstart/>I'm leaving the ship in your hands!
<speaker name="Pilot">Pilot</speaker><boxstart/>I'm heading for Midgar!
<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Comin' and goin'... gettin' pushed around.<boxstart/>But I got a debt to all them back in Midgar that I can't never repay...
<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>It's all right.<boxstart/>You're here... Everyone's all together<boxstart/>Together... we can do anything. We've worked this hard already.
<speaker name="Nanaki">Nanaki</speaker><boxstart/>I wonder why Hojo performed so many of these experiments?<boxstart/>Why couldn't he content himself with quiet research?
<speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>I can't 'pologize to y'all enough.<boxstart/>If I was just a bit more o' a better feller Ain't none of this woulda happened...
<speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>Hojo... what a queer fellow.<boxstart/>Such utter lack of scientific talent... compared with the genius of Dr. Gast......<boxstart/>Lucrecia chose him trying to protect him...<boxstart/>Now I understand... I understand... but...
<speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>We're busy runnin' back and forth!<boxstart/>Even my bikini goddess would be pantin' about now!
<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Headed for... Midgar?<boxstart/>Uh, a, anywhere's fine... I don't care. Just hurry up and land this thing.
<speaker name="Learner Pilot (LV14 Limit Break!)">Learner Pilot (LV14 Limit Break!)</speaker><boxstart/>Yo, Cloud! Whacha gonna do?
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>- Move it!<boxstart/>- Wait
<stage>They fly back to Midgar.</stage>
<speaker name="Pilot">Pilot</speaker><boxstart/>We've reached Midgar!
<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Even if we get there, Midgar's under martial law!<boxstart/>There'll be no way we could slip into the slums.
<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>Looks like all transportation from the slums is cut off......
<speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>Hey, hey, whaddya think we have Highwind for?<boxstart/>Where are we now!?
<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Huh? Where are we...?
<speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>If land's no go... We'll go by air!
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Okay then! We'll parachute into Midgar!!
<stage>Everyone runs off to the deck.</stage>
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Here we go!!
<stage>They all jump off the Highwind and parachute into Midgar, landing in 8th Street, Sector 8.</stage>
<speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>Heidegger is going after you all.<boxstart/>That's why it's dangerous out there. Let's go underground!
<stage>Cloud joins the others around an entrance to the Sector 8 underground.</stage>
<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Sounds strange comin' from me...<boxstart/>But it feels like home bein' back in Midgar.<boxstart/>Kinda makes me sick...
<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>We sure got to know the Midgar underground.
<speaker name="Nanaki">Nanaki</speaker><boxstart/>I have an old score to settle with Hojo, so let's hurry and go!
<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>This place smells gross. Let's get this over with!
<speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>Yeah! Let's get it over with!
<speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>So it was Hojo who stirred up all this commotion, after all these years...?
<speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>This is where we go in.<boxstart/>Please! Hurry and come to the Mako Cannon!
<stage>Cloud and the others make their way through the underground and reach the train tunnel. If Cloud travels backwards down the tunnel instead of ahead, he first comes across Barret.</stage>
<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Leave this to me! Hurry to the cannon!
He starts firing towards their rear.
<stage>Going back far enough, Cloud will reach a dead end with the W-Item materia.</stage>
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Dead end!
<stage>Going forward again, eventually the Turks will intercept Cloud.</stage>
<speaker name="Elena">Elena</speaker><boxstart/>Oh no! They're here!
<stage>Cloud and the others turn to face her as Reno and Rude walk up.</stage>
<speaker name="Elena">Elena</speaker><boxstart/>What are we going to do!? I think it's okay for you to ignore your orders now.
<speaker name="Reno">Reno</speaker><boxstart/>...Elena, don't act so weak.
<speaker name="Rude">Rude</speaker><boxstart/>We're Turks, Elena.
<speaker name="Elena">Elena</speaker><boxstart/>...Yes, sir. You're right.
<speaker name="Rude">Rude</speaker><boxstart/>Come on, we've got work to do.
<speaker name="Reno">Reno</speaker><boxstart/>I'm not really up for it, but...
<speaker name="Elena">Elena</speaker><boxstart/>Our orders were to seek you out and...<boxstart/>...Kill.<boxstart/>Our company may be in turmoil, but an order's an order.<boxstart/>That's the will and spirit of the Turks! Believe it!
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>......
<speaker name="Elena">Elena</speaker><boxstart/>What are you doing! Let's go!
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>- Okay, let's end this<boxstart/>- No, let's not go

  <speaker name="Cloud"><boxstart/>Okay, let's end this</speaker>
  <speaker name="Reno">Reno</speaker><boxstart/>I know we have a weird relationship, but...<boxstart/>We have to end this... like Turks!
  <stage>A battle ensues.</stage>
  <speaker name="Elena">Elena</speaker> (attacking)<boxstart/>Try this on for size!
  <stage>Cloud and the others attack her.</stage>
  <speaker name="Elena">Elena</speaker><boxstart/>Yeow! That hurts!<boxstart/>Take THAT!!
  She casts Infatuation.
  <speaker name="Rude">Rude</speaker><boxstart/>............
  <speaker name="Reno">Reno</speaker><boxstart/>Let's call it a day.
  <stage>They flee.</stage>


  <speaker name="Cloud"><boxstart/>No, let's not go</speaker>
  <speaker name="Elena">Elena</speaker><boxstart/>You showing pity!? Don't take the Turks for fools!
  <speaker name="Reno">Reno</speaker><boxstart/>Wait, Elena.
  <speaker name="Elena">Elena</speaker><boxstart/>Reno! You're not violating the order... are you!?
  <speaker name="Reno">Reno</speaker><boxstart/>Shinra's finished. It's come down to this.
  <speaker name="Rude">Rude</speaker><boxstart/>......
  <speaker name="Elena">Elena</speaker><boxstart/>Rude...
  <speaker name="Reno">Reno</speaker><boxstart/>Elena, you were a great Turk!
  <speaker name="Elena">Elena</speaker><boxstart/>......
  <speaker name="Reno">Reno</speaker><boxstart/>Farewell. If we both survive...<boxstart/>If we can save our lives...
  He walks off.
  <speaker name="Elena">Elena</speaker><boxstart/>Remember the spirit of the Turks...!
  She salutes and runs off.
  <speaker name="Rude">Rude</speaker><boxstart/>Our mission's finished...
  He follows the others.

<stage>Cloud and the others move on. At the first branch in the tunnel, they find Yuffie.</stage>
<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon---!
<stage>At the next is Cid.</stage>
<speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>Which way...!?<boxstart/>Goddamn, piece of $#@^% cannon!!
<stage>Going left takes them to the Shinra building.</stage>
<speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>No, no! The Sister Ray's not this way!
<stage>Cloud retraces his steps to find the right path, finding Tifa crouched down on the tracks. She stands.</stage>
<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>I'm all right! Hurry and go to the cannon!
<stage>Eventually Cloud comes out in the streets of Sector 8 again, near the supports for the cannon. They head for the stairs, but the ground starts shaking, and they stop and look back.</stage>
<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>What the... hell is that!!?
<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>This can't be...
<speaker name="Nanaki">Nanaki</speaker><boxstart/>!?
<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Are you serious...?
<speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>......!
<speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>Hey-hey! You serious...?
<stage>The hatch of the huge mecha opens.</stage>
<speaker name="Heidegger">Heidegger</speaker><boxstart/>G'yaaa, Haaa, Haaa!!! Here they come!<boxstart/>G'yaaa, Haaa, Haaa!!! So they really showed up!<boxstart/>You sure did treat us like dogs up to now!!
<speaker name="Scarlet">Scarlet</speaker><boxstart/>You killed off a lot of my precious soldiers!
<speaker name="Heidegger">Heidegger</speaker><boxstart/>G'yaaa, Haaa, Haaa!!! But let's see how you do against anti-Weapon artillery!
<speaker name="Scarlet">Scarlet</speaker><boxstart/>You guys are worthless, but my proud creation is a sure thing!
<stage>They go back inside the hatch.</stage>
<speaker name="Scarlet">Scarlet</speaker><boxstart/>I'll show you the destructive power of the Proud Clod!
<stage>A battle ensues, and they defeat the Proud Clod.</stage>
<speaker name="Scarlet">Scarlet</speaker><boxstart/>Not that! This is the proud Clod.........!?
<speaker name="Heidegger">Heidegger</speaker><boxstart/>Whoooooa!!
<stage>The Proud Clod explodes. It starts to rain, and Cloud and the others move on down the street and start up the stairs to the Sister Ray.</stage>
<speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>This way, Cloud!
<speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker> (on a lower platform, watching)<boxstart/>Damn! Hojo...!
<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Hey! This is...
Received "Missing Score"!
<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>This is great. Hold on, Hojo......!
<stage>They reach Hojo, who is working at the cannon's controls.</stage>
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Hojo! Stop right there!!
<speaker name="Hojo">Hojo</speaker><boxstart/>Oh... the failure.
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>At least remember my name! It's Cloud!
<speaker name="Hojo">Hojo</speaker><boxstart/>Every time I see you, I...<boxstart/>It pains me that I had so little scientific sense...<boxstart/>I evaluated you as a failed project.<boxstart/>But, you are the only one that succeeded as a Sephiroth-clone.<boxstart/>Heh, heh, heh...... I'm even beginning to hate myself.
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>None of that matters... just stop this nonsense!
<speaker name="Hojo">Hojo</speaker> (pausing)<boxstart/>...nonsense?<boxstart/>Oh, this?
He turns around.
<boxstart/>Ha, ha, ha...<boxstart/>Sephiroth seems to be counting on the energy.<boxstart/>So I'm going to lend him a hand.
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Why!? Why do that!?
<speaker name="Hojo">Hojo</speaker><boxstart/>Quit asking me why, you moron.<boxstart/>Hmm... actually, you might be cut out to be a scientist.
He turns back to the controls.
<boxstart/>Energy level is at...... 83%. It's taking too long.<boxstart/>My son is in need of power and help. ...That's the only reason.
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>...your son?
<speaker name="Hojo">Hojo</speaker><boxstart/>Ha, ha, ha... Although he doesn't know.<boxstart/>Ha, ha, ha... HA, HA, HA...!!<boxstart/>What will Sephiroth think when he finds out I'm his father?<boxstart/>Always looking down on me like that.<boxstart/>HA, HA, HA...!!
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Sephiroth is your son!?
<speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>......!
<speaker name="Hojo">Hojo</speaker><boxstart/>Ha, ha, ha...<boxstart/>I offered the woman with my child to Professor Gast's Jenova Project.<boxstart/>When Sephiroth was still in the womb, we took the cells of Jenova...<boxstart/>HA, HA, HA!!
<speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>You......!
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>I can't believe you're the one who did this...<boxstart/>The illusionary crime against Sephiroth...
<stage>Hojo turns around.</stage>
<speaker name="Hojo">Hojo</speaker><boxstart/>Heee, hee, hee, hee! No you're wrong!<boxstart/>It's my desire as a scientist! Heee, hee, hee, hee!
<speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>......<boxstart/>I was...wrong. The one that should have slept was...<boxstart/>...You, Hojo!
<speaker name="Hojo">Hojo</speaker><boxstart/>I... was defeated by my desire to become a scientist.<boxstart/>I lost the last time as well.<boxstart/>I've injected Jenova's cells into my own body!<boxstart/>Heee, hee, hee!<boxstart/>Here are...<boxstart/>Heee, hee, hee!<boxstart/>...my results!!
<stage>A battle ensues.</stage>
<speaker name="Hojo">Hojo</speaker><boxstart/>Gwah, haw, haw!!<boxstart/>Haw... now let's see<boxstart/>how the Mako juice is reacting?
<stage>Hojo morphs into Helletic Hojo, and later into Lifeform Hojo. Cloud and the others manage to defeat him.</stage>
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>......
<speaker name="Nanaki">Nanaki</speaker><boxstart/>The father...
<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>I can't believe Sephiroth is Hojo's son...
<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Anyway... that's the end of the cannon...
<speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>%$#&amp;$*&amp;^%^
<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>How sad... for him...
<speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>Hojo...rest in peace...
<speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>I'm so glad you came.
