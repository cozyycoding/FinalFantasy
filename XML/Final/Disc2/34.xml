North Corel - Huge Materia

Arrival at the Corel Reactor
Return to North Corel
Back on the Highwind

<stage>At Kalm...</stage>
<speaker name="Redhead">Redhead</speaker><boxstart/>Hey, listen to me! The Shinra troops are on the move.<boxstart/>The TV news said Rufus came up with 2 plans. One, is to launch a rocket into space containing Huge Materia......<boxstart/>Is Huge Materia really that destructive?

<stage>At Corel...</stage>
<speaker name="Man">Man</speaker><boxstart/>Shinra soldiers came around sayin' they were gathering up all the Huge Materia.<boxstart/>I think they're gonna bring it here by coal train, from the Corel Reactor.
<speaker name="Big Man">Big Man</speaker><boxstart/>Some Shinra soldiers went up to Mt. Corel. They said they're collecting Huge Materia to blow up Meteor!<boxstart/>Ya think they can really do it...? I'll bet the reactor destroys everything even before Meteor hits!
<stage>Cid and the others travel through the mountains to the Corel Reactor.</stage>
<speaker name="Soldier">Soldier</speaker><boxstart/>You guys are...!
<stage>They fight and defeat the two soldiers guarding the door.</stage>
<speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>Guess we're safe for now...!
<stage>A train whistle sounds.</stage>

	<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Da---mn!
	<speaker name="Nanaki">Nanaki</speaker><boxstart/>Ohh!
	<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Wa... wait!
	<speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>Wha... what is it, what is it!
	<speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>!!

<stage>They get out of the way as a train exits the reactor.</stage>
<speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>Looks like they're takin' off with the Huge Materia in that train!

	<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>NO! You damn boneheads!
	<speaker name="Nanaki">Nanaki</speaker><boxstart/>Did the Shinra beat us!?
	<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>What are ya gonna do!? Huge Materia!?
	<speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>Wha... you're not thinking about giving up...
	<speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>...go after them?

<speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>Hey, do you know who I am?<boxstart/>I'm Cid - that's who the hell I am! Now just let me handle it!
<stage>They run inside the reactor and another whistle sounds.</stage>
<speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>Hey, hey, hey, hey---!
<stage>They come out riding a smaller train.</stage>

	<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>How can they even drive this?
	<speaker name="Nanaki">Nanaki</speaker><boxstart/>It sure helped having Cid here. I had no idea he could drive a train...
	<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Pretty good for an old guy. I'm impressed you can move this thing!
	<speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>Way to go, Mister! You used to drivin' this thing too?
	<speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>I'm impressed. You can drive this too...?

<speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>Don't ask me... I don't know!

	<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>What!?
	<speaker name="Nanaki">Nanaki</speaker><boxstart/>Wa...What!?
	<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>What!? You serious!?
	<speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>Huh? What'd you just say!?
	<speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>Wha... what...!?

<speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>Don't worry! I can handle this kinda stuff!<boxstart/>Two levers; one on the right and one on the left...<boxstart/>I see, just alternate the two levers up and down, right!?<boxstart/>Judging from the enemy's speed, I'd say it'll take about 10 minutes.<boxstart/>We're gonna fly!! Hold on tight!!

  <stage><speaker name="Cloud"><boxstart/>If they fail to catch up to Shinra's train...</speaker></stage>
  <speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>DAMN!<boxstart/>Sorry! I couldn't catch up to them!
  <stage>They walk into North Corel, which is unharmed.</stage>
  <speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>Sorry... I never shoulda gave that Huge Materia to the Shinra so easily...
  
	  <speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Can't keep regrettin' the past... It's the future we gotta think about now.
	  <speaker name="Nanaki">Nanaki</speaker><boxstart/>What are we going to do now?
	  <speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>No use baggin' on yourself! It's not like you, OLD guy!
	  <speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>It's not all over yet. Cheer up!
	  <speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>...Isn't it too early to give up?
  


  <stage><speaker name="Cloud"><boxstart/>If they catch up to Shinra's train in time...</speaker></stage>
	<speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>All right! We're gonna jump!!
	<stage>They jump to the other train and fight their way to the front.</stage>
	<speaker name="Soldier Driving">Soldier Driving</speaker><boxstart/>What the! You... you guys!
	<speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>All right--- Just hand over the Huge Materia!
	<speaker name="Soldier Driving">Soldier Driving</speaker><boxstart/>Sh......<boxstart/>Whooooa----!
	<stage>They fight off the soldier.</stage>
	<speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>You got guts comin' after me!<boxstart/>I'll never forget you!
	
		<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Got no time for that now!
		<speaker name="Nanaki">Nanaki</speaker><boxstart/>We got it going, but what about the brakes?
		<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Forget about the Huge Materia, WE'RE the ones in deep trouble!
		<speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>What are we gonna do, kill off the engineer!?
		<speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>Hit the brakes, Chief.
	
	<speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>I KNOW, already! Just shut up and keep quiet! If we keep this up, we'll crash right into North Corel!<boxstart/>Let's see... If we alternately use the levers to accelerate, ...<boxstart/>It should brake if we move the levers up or down simultaneously!
	
		<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Hey, it's not working!
		<speaker name="Nanaki">Nanaki</speaker><boxstart/>We're gaining speed!
		<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>What are you doin' accelerating!?
		<speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>Hey---------WAIT! ...other way, other way, other way!

	  <speaker name="Man">Man</speaker><boxstart/>To you it may be a junk yard, but to us its home.
	  If Barret is in the party, he will instead say:
	  It might be full of junk, but this is the only home we got, Barret!!
	  <speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Of... of course! We're all born and raised in the coal mines!!<boxstart/>No matter how tough it gets, our hearts burn bright red like coal!

	  <speaker name="Man">Man</speaker><boxstart/>God, what have we done...?<boxstart/>Well, no use just sitting around talking about it. What can we do to get things back to normal?
	  <speaker name="Man 2">Man 2</speaker><boxstart/>While you guys were relaxing, Shinra troops took the Huge Materia.

<stage>Back on the Highwind...</stage>
<speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>What's next? Shall we head for Fort Condor?

<speaker name="Nanaki">Nanaki</speaker><boxstart/>We'll do our best for Cloud and you.<boxstart/>......And Aerith, too.
<speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>......Don't expect anything else from me except fighting beside you.<boxstart/>I don't have any comforting words.<boxstart/>Of course, I don't believe you're the type of guy who needs kindness from other's...... 
<stage>It is possible to do Fort Condor first and Corel second, in which case the dialogue is different:</stage>
<speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>There's only one more Huge Materia the Shinra needs... That's the one at the Underwater Reactor.
<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>We've got to hurry and stop 'em!!
<speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>With us always in their face, even the Shinra's gotta be getting tired of it all.<boxstart/>We have to hurry that much... ...right now I'm more worried about him than anything else!
