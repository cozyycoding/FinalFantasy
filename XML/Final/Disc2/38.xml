<sp> Rocket Town - Huge Materia </sp>

<sp> Arrival at the Rocket </sp>
<sp> The Launch </sp>
<sp> The Huge Materia </sp>
<sp> The Escape Pod </sp>
<sp> Back on the Highwind </sp>
<sp> The Aftermath in Rocket Town </sp>

<sp> Cloud and the others arrive at Rocket Town. </sp>
<sp> Inside the inn... </sp>
<sp> BarkeeperSeems like Palmer of Shinra, Inc. ordered soldiers to restore the rocket... </sp>
<sp> ManEven with all this goin' on outside, that guy still won't come out of the bathroom? He must be a damn water tank!? </sp>
<sp> Back outside... </sp>
<sp> MechanicWhat's young president Rufus doing by getting all those mechanics together? </sp>
<sp> RedheadThe Shinra serious 'bout launching that piece of crap rocket? But why now...? </sp>
<sp> Old ManThere's a bunch of Shinra people here messin' with the rocket...Is my rocket... all right? </sp>
<sp> Cloud heads for the rocket. Below, a couple stands watching. </sp>
<sp> ManMmmmm, a SPECTACLE. </sp>
<sp> WomanIs something about to happen? Oh, I'm getting excited. </sp>
<sp> SoldiersThose terrorists are here! </sp>
<sp> Cloud fights off the first two soldiers and runs up the stairs. </sp>
<sp> SoldiersDon't let them get any further! Everyone, ATTACK---!Urrrgh, you're not going anywhere! Uh un, nowhere! </sp>
<sp> Cloud fights off those soldiers. </sp>

  If Cid is not in the party...
  Cid runs up the steps to join Cloud.
  CidWait, Cloud!If you're gonna kick those *#$% Shinra out of my rocket, then take me with you!ALL RIGHT! Let's show those &amp;$!@&amp; Shinra!


  If Cid is in the party...
  CidGoddammit, what the hell do they think they're gonna do to my rocket!?I'm outta here, Cloud! I'm gonna kick those $^%$# Shinra right out of my rocket!

<sp> They go on up the ladder and run into Rude of the Turks. </sp>
<sp> Rude...you again?...We will eliminate everyone who gets in Shinra's way. </sp>
<sp> They fight Rude. </sp>
<sp> RudeUgh......... gh...............they got us....hmm. </sp>
<sp> Cloud and the others enter the rocket. </sp>
<sp> CommanderYou... you! Why are you here? Rude of the Turks should've been here!! </sp>
<sp> CloudToo bad. Those guys are over there. </sp>
<sp> CommanderOh man... the Turks, being done in like that... But, I won't let you through! </sp>
<sp> They fight off the commander. </sp>
<sp> Commanderurrrrgh... </sp>
<sp> They continue into the cockpit, where Cid's old crew is preparing for the launch. </sp>
<sp> CidHey! What the hell're you guys doin'!? </sp>
<sp> Mechanic 1Hey! Just when I thought somethin' was goin' on, you come back! </sp>
<sp> Mechanic 3Listen to me, Captain. We're gonna launch this rocket! </sp>
<sp> CidHuh? What are you talkin' 'bout? </sp>
<sp> Mechanic 2We're gonna load a Materia bomb in this and blow up Meteor. </sp>
<sp> Mechanic 1Our rocket's gonna save the planet! </sp>
<sp> Mechanic 2Urrrrgh. Man this is so COOL!! </sp>
<sp> CloudWait a minute! </sp>
<sp> CidShut up!! Just shut the hell up! </sp>
<sp> He turns back to his crew. </sp>
<sp> How's the rocket? </sp>
<sp> Cloud turns to the other party member and shrugs. </sp>
<sp> Mechanic 1It's pretty much OK. </sp>
<sp> Mechanic 2But... </sp>
<sp> Mechanic 3We planned to run it into Meteor on Auto-Pilot, but the most important device is broken. </sp>
<sp> CidBroken? How's the repair goin'? </sp>
<sp> Mechanic 3Shera's doin' it... </sp>
<sp> CidOh great! What a buncha wizards you guys are! She's gonna take a 100 years!I'll take over, so don't worry about the Auto-Pilot!Hey, go ahead! Go tell everyone! </sp>
<sp> MechanicsAll right, Captain. Good luck. </sp>
<sp> They all run out. </sp>
<sp> CloudHey, Cid! What're you doing!?There are generations of knowledge and wisdom inside the Materia.We're gonna borrow their powers and save the planet from Sephiroth.There's no way that we can lose the Huge Materia. You understand that, right? </sp>
<sp> CidYeah, I understand. I understand that Materia is precious, and I also understand what you're thinking.But listen.I don't give a rat's ass whether it's science or magical power.No, I guess if I had to choose, I'd rather put my money on the power of science.Humans who used to only roam around on the ground are able to fly now!And finally, we're about to go into outer space.Science is a "Power" created and developed by humans. And science just might be what saves this planet.I was able to earn my living thanks to science. So to me, there's nothing greater!Now quit your worrying 'bout what Shinra's gonna do!I don't want to regret not having done something later. </sp>
<sp> CloudBut, Cid...... </sp>
<sp> CidShut the hell up!! I don't wanna hear it!!Alright, time to get to work! Anyone who ain't involved, get the hell outta here! </sp>
<sp> The rocket starts shaking. </sp>
<sp> CidWhat the hell......? What the hell happened!? </sp>
<sp> Palmer (over the intercom)Hey-hey! </sp>
<sp> CidPalmer! What the hell did'ya do!? </sp>
<sp> PalmerThey said they finished repairing the Auto-Pilot. So, I laun---ched it! </sp>
<sp> CidGoddamn Shera! Why'd she pick today to get fast! </sp>
<sp> He runs to the control panel. </sp>
<sp> DAMN! Won't even budge! It's completely locked up! </sp>
<sp> PalmerHey-hey-hey! Almost lift off! </sp>
<sp> CidWhat the!? No countdown!? It just don't seem the same without it! </sp>
<sp> PalmerHey!!!! Hey-hey!!! Blast-----off! </sp>
<sp> The rocket launches into space. </sp>
<sp> CidI finally made it... outer space...Let's see, how's the course set...?Yup, it's headed for a collision with Meteor. </sp>
<sp> BarretCan't we do somethin'? We can't jus' leave it. </sp>
<sp> TifaCan't we do something? If it goes on, we're...... </sp>
<sp> NanakiWhat should we do? Are we all going to die? </sp>
<sp> YuffieHey old man! Do something! </sp>
<sp> Cait SithWhat shall we do? What shall we do?I'm a toy, so I don't care, but for all of you it's a different story... </sp>
<sp> VincentWe're in space now. A long rest... </sp>
<sp> CidThat damn Palmer went outta his way to lock the Auto-Pilot device. We might not be able to change the course. </sp>
<sp> Cloud...this is the end? </sp>
<sp> CidHuh? What the hell're you sayin'? You're still young, and you give up that easily?I'm not gonna crash into Meteor.Just watch.I keep an Escape Pod on the rocket just for emergencies like this.I deciphered the lock code on the Escape Pod. We'll bail right before we crash into Meteor. </sp>
<sp> BarretHey wait a second!What's gonna happen to the Huge Materia? </sp>
<sp> TifaHey, what about the Huge Materia? </sp>
<sp> NanakiBut, what are we going to do with the Huge Materia? Are we just going to give it up? </sp>
<sp> YuffieHmm? What are we gonna do with the Huge Materia?If you don't want it, maybe... you could... give it to ME! </sp>
<sp> Cait SithBy the way, what are we goin' to do with the Huge Materia? </sp>
<sp> VincentThen the remaining question is what to do with the Huge Materia. </sp>
<sp> Cid......If you want the Materia, do whatever you want!The Materia should be there after you climb that ladder. </sp>
<sp> Cloud...You sure? </sp>
<sp> CidI dunno...I know what I said a minute ago.But maybe all that I really wanted was just to go into outer space.So, why don't you all do whatever you think is right? </sp>
<sp> Cloud climbs the ladder to where the Huge Materia is kept. </sp>
<sp> CloudI finally found the Huge Materia... </sp>
<sp> CidIt's structured so that the lock can be opened if we enter the passcode from this control panel.Hey Cloud, you know how to use it, right?Everytime it says, 'Enter Passcode,' push one of those buttons.If you punch in the right code, it'll unlock and you can get the Huge Materia! </sp>
<sp> CloudSo, what order am I supposed to enter the passcode in? </sp>
<sp> CidI dunno. Just try and punch in the code randomly. </sp>
<sp> Passcode input errorUnauthorized User identifiedProtection System will activate in 3 minutes </sp>
<sp> CidSeems like you missed the code!If we don't enter the correct passcode before the Protection System activates, we won't be able to get the Materia back!I heard there's a passcode only the top people in Shinra know.We probably have to enter that. Try and enter some codes while I try and remember that passcode! </sp>
<sp> Cid tries to give Cloud instructions. </sp>

  If they succeed...
  Passcode ConfirmedIdentified as an Authorized UserUnlocked
  CidAlright, Cloud!! It's unlocked!Yup, my great advice saved the day.
  Received Key Item "Huge Materia"!


  If they fail...
  Protection System Activated
  CidAhhh &amp;$#$#! The Protection System just activated!...Cloud, too bad, but we gotta let it go.

<sp> Cloud and the others make for the escape pod. As they pass through the engine room, one of the oxygen tanks explodes. </sp>
<sp> CidGrrrgh!Damn! My leg's stuck in the debris...... </sp>
<sp> CloudCid!! </sp>
<sp> The others move to lift the debris. </sp>
<sp> Barret...damn! ...can't lift it! </sp>
<sp> Tifa...I can't! It's so heavy, I can't lift it... </sp>
<sp> NanakiI can't do anything with my strength alone......! </sp>
<sp> YuffieI can't budge it by myself!! </sp>
<sp> Cait SithWhat shall we do--- It won't budge! </sp>
<sp> Vincent...no. I can't lift it. </sp>
<sp> CidDon't worry 'bout me. Hurry up and go! If you don't hurry, the rocket's gonna crash into Meteor! </sp>
<sp> Cloud...I can't go without my friends. </sp>
<sp> CidYou ^%#@&amp;%......! No time to worry 'bout other people! </sp>
<sp> CloudI'm gonna do whatever I can. </sp>
<sp> CidYou're stupid. You're really $#&amp;^%$* stupid.Tank Number 8 blew up...... So Tank Number 8... really was malfunctioning......Shera... You were right.But, ......this is the end for me. </sp>
<sp> The door opens. </sp>
<sp> SheraDon't say that, Cid. </sp>
<sp> CidHuh!? Shera!? </sp>
<sp> SheraI tagged along. I'm coming to help you. </sp>
<sp> She moves to help Cloud pull. </sp>
<sp> CidYou stupid &amp;$#&amp;%*%&amp;%#!!......Sorry. </sp>
<sp> With Shera's help, they manage to free Cid, and she leads them towards the escape pod. </sp>
<sp> SheraThe Escape Pod is this way. Please hurry. </sp>
<sp> They follow Shera to the pod. </sp>
<sp> SheraHurry. I'm going to detach the Escape Pod. </sp>
<sp> CidHey, Shera! Does this Pod really fly? </sp>
<sp> SheraIt'll be OK. I've been checking it till now. </sp>
<sp> Cid.........Then I'm relieved. </sp>
<sp> Shera......Thanks. </sp>
<sp> They detach in the escape pod. </sp>
<sp> Cid (plastered to the window)So this is...... outer space...Man... it's the real thing... I'm really here in outer space...So long, Shinra No. 26... </sp>
<sp> The rocket goes on to crash into Meteor. The explosion is blinding, but afterwards, Meteor remains, barely harmed at all. </sp>
<sp> Back on the Highwind... </sp>
<sp> CloudRufus and the others plan was a failure... </sp>
<sp> BarretWhat a bust... But I kinda hoped it'd work. </sp>
<sp> Cait SithWe been botherin' them as much as we can...But there ain't no other way... Wonder if we've been wrong all this time? </sp>
<sp> NanakiMakes you worry, doesn't it? </sp>
<sp> TifaDon't worry! Think! </sp>
<sp> CidHey! The girl's right.You start worryin' and there's no stoppin' it! Things just start fallin' apart and get worse and worse. </sp>
<sp> BarretYou're pretty damn optimistic! You up to somethin'? </sp>
<sp> CidYeah, I been thinkin' about this and that.All the time we been up here lookin' at the planet.I been thinkin' even when we were floatin' in the ocean in that escape pod. </sp>
<sp> CloudI've... been thinking too. About the universe... planet... ocean.How wide and big... No matter where I go and what I do it won't change a thing. </sp>
<sp> CidMaybe you're right.But I came up with something different.I always thought this planet was so huge.But lookin' at it from space, I realized it's so small.We're just floatin' in the dark. ......kind of makes you feel powerless.On top of that it's got Sephiroth festerin' inside it like a sickness.That's why I say this planet's still a kid.A little kid sick and trembling in the middle of this huge universe.Someone's gotta protect it.Ya follow me? That someone is us. </sp>
<sp> TifaCid... that's beautiful. </sp>
<sp> BarretYo! Cid! You even got to me!Do, now what? How're we gonna protect the planet from Meteor? </sp>
<sp> Cid scratches his head and sits down. </sp>
<sp> Cid...............I'm still thinkin' about that. </sp>
<sp> The others shake their heads and disperse. </sp>
<sp> NanakiHuh!?Did you...... hear something? </sp>
<sp> They hear the Planet's screaming. </sp>
<sp> TifaThe planet's scream...... or Meteor...? Is it this planet? </sp>
<sp> CloudHey, how do we know that this is really the planet's scream? </sp>
<sp> TifaDid you forget?Bugenhagen told us. </sp>
<sp> CloudBugenhagen... </sp>
<sp> NanakiLet's go see Grandfather! To Cosmo Canyon!I'm sure he'll be able to tell us something that will be helpful! </sp>
<sp> BarretThat Bugenhagen guy... He was a weird old dude.I thought he was some kinda naturalist, but he was all into them machines. </sp>
<sp> TifaDid Bugenhagen...... tell you anything? </sp>
<sp> NanakiHurry, hurry! We must go meet Grandfather! </sp>
<sp> Cait SithThis's just between you 'n' me but...That there Bugenhagen feller, used to be a pretty handy Shinra worker.Yep, he ain't never bought no weapons or Mako though...... </sp>
<sp> VincentThe machines in Cosmo Canyon were presents of Dr. Gast.Wrapped up in the planet's strange notions surrounded by Shinra-made machines...Science and the planet lived side by side in that old man's heart. </sp>
<sp> CidMaybe it's just me, but has this ship been remodeled without me knowin' it?All these switches and levers. They're kinda gettin' to me. </sp>
<sp> YuffieWhat? Are we there?I know it's all for Wutai, But I can't take much more of this. </sp>
<sp> Learner Pilot (L10)Shall we go? </sp>
<sp> Cloud- Let's- No, let's not </sp>
<sp> Afterwards, in Rocket Town... </sp>
<sp> Inside the inn... </sp>
<sp> BarkeeperEven though they failed to blow up Meteor with the rocket, the Shinra haven't given up yet...Looks like they're gathering all the weapons from all their bases and are preparing for a final showdown. </sp>
<sp> ManOK, which is it gonna be? Meteor hits us first, or that guy comes out of the bathroom?I'm not movin' from this spot till I see it with my own eyes. </sp>
<sp> Inside a house... </sp>
<sp> ManEven the rocket launch wasn't all THAT great. </sp>
<sp> WomanNow that one of Shinra's greatest events is over, I guess it's back to the same old boring everyday life again... </sp>
<sp> In the Item Shop... </sp>
<sp> WomanIs Gramps gonna stay like that even though rocket's gone? </sp>
<sp> Back outside... </sp>
<sp> Old ManMy, my precious rocket... It's gone.Hmph, I know. No matter how much I look, the rocket's still gone.But I just can't stop it. Just call it an old man's folly if you will.Sorry to get you into this. For me, it's a kinda hobby.But, out of appreciation, let me give you this. </sp>
<sp> Received "Venus Gospel"! </sp>
<sp> Old ManI wish you'd take care of it and use it...Maybe it's time for me to get a new hobby...Mmm. You know that Shinra sports car at Cid's house? It might be fun to try and restore that thing... </sp>
<sp> RedheadI get so restless now that the rocket's gone. And now that we can see Meteor clearly, ...I can't stand it. </sp>
<sp> MechanicI still can't believe that piece of crap rocket actually made it into space... I guess the mechanic was a genius. </sp>
<sp> Cid's house... </sp>
<sp> SheraNow all we have to take care of is Meteor, right? You should be able...Excuse me...... Please take care of the Captain. </sp>
<sp> Cloud and the others leave for Cosmo Canyon. </sp>
