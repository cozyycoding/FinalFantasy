<sp> Lower Junon </sp>
<sp> The Underwater Reactor </sp>
<sp> Stealing a Submarine </sp>
<sp> Back in Junon </sp>
<sp> Gelnika </sp>

<sp> Cloud and the others arrive at lower Junon. </sp>
<sp> WomanThey say Shinra's gathering Huge Materia from around the world and bringing it to Junon.Bringing it to Junon must mean they want to use their airplanes.I've noticed there's been a lot of Shinra ships recently. I think they're going to the off-shore Underwater Reactor.Isn't Shinra trying to transport the Reactor's Huge Materia? </sp>
<sp> Older ManI remember years ago, seein' the Shinra build a long pipe underwater.The underwater reactor is connected to Junon by a pipe.You should be able to get to the reactor through it. </sp>
<sp> PriscillaWho are you---?Cloud!!Stupid jerk! Look how much you made me worry!! Were you at the Lifestream? </sp>
<sp> CloudYeah, that's right. </sp>
<sp> PriscillaYou've gotta be more careful! Because you're going to marry me one day. </sp>
<sp> Soldier by ElevatorIf you want to get on the elevator that badly, give me 10 gil! </sp>
<sp> Cloud- Okay, I guess </sp>
<sp> Soldier by ElevatorHurry up and get in! </sp>
<sp> Cloud takes the elevator to Upper Junon. </sp>
<sp> Soldier on the Path to the AirportThe Shinra's collecting Huge Materia at the Junon Undersea Reactor!When they're done, they'll bring it to this airport.Get out of here before you get in the way!What... me? I'm gonna be watching from here, so that I don't get in their way either! </sp>
<sp> Cloud runs outside to the airport. </sp>
<sp> SoldierAfter they get it, they'll take it to the airport and will transport it to Rocket Town by Gelnika. Don't let your guard down! </sp>
<sp> Soldier 2They've finally started collecting the Huge Materia from the Junon Underwater Reactor. </sp>
<sp> Cloud leaves the base and starts down the street, then stops and turns to his companions. </sp>
<sp> CloudI may be mistaken, but...... Doesn't it feel like we're missing something? </sp>
<sp> Cloud and the others continue on. On the way to the reactor, they come across a commander drilling his soldiers. </sp>
<sp> CommanderAll right!! Let's see how hard you trained!Attention! Charge--!! </sp>
<sp> The soldiers all charge in the opposite direction. </sp>
<sp> CommanderHe... hey--!! That's the Underwater Reactor!! Come back!! </sp>
<sp> Cloud gets on the first elevator with two soldiers and a redhead. </sp>
<sp> SoldierHow 'bout, whoever stays alive, gets to take her out? </sp>
<sp> Soldier 2All right, you're on!!But... What if both of us... </sp>
<sp> SoldierWhoa!! Don't even talk about that! </sp>
<sp> Cloud defeats both of them. </sp>
<sp> Redhead...gulp... (Great... there went two perfectly good men!) </sp>
<sp> The elevator reaches the lower floor. </sp>
<sp> Soldier 3OK! Back to work!! Back to work!! </sp>
<sp> Soldier 4Yawn... I'm sleepy!! </sp>
<sp> Soldier 3For Junon!! </sp>
<sp> Cloud and the others continue on down another elevator and through the underwater pipe to the reactor. </sp>
<sp> Soldiers in ReactorYou, you're Cloud!!You are NOT getting this Huge Materia!!So you WERE after the Huge Materia! </sp>
<sp> Cloud and the others reach where the Huge Materia is stored. </sp>
<sp> Cloud!? The Huge Materia! </sp>
<sp> They watch as a machine arm reaches down and pulls out the materia. </sp>
<sp> YuffieHey! A Crane Game! </sp>
<sp> BarretDamn, just missed it! </sp>
<sp> VincentWe were a little late... </sp>
<sp> CidThat's what you think! ^%$@#&amp;$#! </sp>
<sp> TifaThey're gonna take it on that submarine! </sp>
<sp> NanakiIf we take a short cut, we might just make it......! </sp>
<sp> Cait SithThere's the submarine dock just ahead of us. </sp>
<sp> They run to the submarine docks. Reno is standing with his back to them, supervising. </sp>
<sp> CloudDid we make it!? </sp>
<sp> He watches as the Huge Materia is lowered into the red submarine. </sp>
<sp> RenoWhat are you doing? Help load. </sp>
<sp> He turns around. </sp>
<sp> Cloud!? </sp>
<sp> NanakiHelp? </sp>
<sp> BarretWe're gonna help transport the Huge Materia... Reno! </sp>
<sp> YuffieI'm SURE! You want me to do manual labor? </sp>
<sp> CidYou know I don't work for cheap! </sp>
<sp> VincentI refuse... </sp>
<sp> TifaLooks like we barely made it. </sp>
<sp> CloudEither give it to us or else....which is it gonna be? </sp>
<sp> RenoUnfortunately, I don't have time to deal with you.My priority is the Huge Materia! </sp>
<sp> He runs off, leaving Cloud and the others to fight a robot. After the battle, they find the red sub has already left. </sp>
<sp> CloudDamn! The submarine! </sp>
<sp> Yuffie!? The Huge Materia! </sp>
<sp> BarretDamn! So they was just buyin' time!? </sp>
<sp> TifaWe have to go after it! </sp>
<sp> NanakiBut it's already in the water! </sp>
<sp> Cait SithIt left the dock! </sp>
<sp> VincentThere is one way... </sp>
<sp> CidHold on to your horses! Let's get it from them!! </sp>
<sp> They run for the other submarine, and the soldiers on board turn frantic. </sp>
<sp> SoldiersY, you...!You're not taking over this ship! </sp>
<sp> They defeat the soldiers and get on board. </sp>
<sp> SoldiersYou want the Sub? Just try an' take it!Um... sir! Maybe we shouldn't piss them off... </sp>
<sp> They fight off these soldiers, too. </sp>
<sp> BarretCome on, Cloud! Follow me!Damn, man!! ......what the...?Hey yo! Remember I was the leader first, man!Yo! We come a long ways since we got on that train!Lotsa things changed! This and that. </sp>
<sp> They enter the bridge. </sp>
<sp> CommanderNO, NO!! This is terrible! </sp>
<sp> SoldiersWe don't have much time left! I don't want to die!There's still so much more I've got to do!I never even got to do my special victory dance in battle! </sp>

  Take them prisoner
  The soldiers move aside to let Cloud and the others into the control room.

<sp> Cloud crouches down, wringing his hands. Yuffie doesn't look any better off. </sp>
<sp> CloudSomeone... please. I'm sorry I can't take it anymore.The lack of space, the shaking, the roar of the engine... </sp>
<sp> BarretStop your blubberin'!! How we gonna move this without you? </sp>
<sp> YuffieI... I can't... I'm history. </sp>
<sp> Cait SithI can't fit in this seat... No good! </sp>
<sp> VincentBetter hurry. Reno's getting away. </sp>
<sp> Tifa, Nanaki, or Cid goes up to the control panel and presses a button. </sp>
<sp> TifaSee!?Just fiddle with the controls, and we'll get somewhere!Hey Cloud? Why don't you try piloting it?They say you don't get motion sickness if you're driving. </sp>
<sp> NanakiIt moved!Cloud!! Try it! </sp>
<sp> CidHunka junk... just gotta do this!SEE! Now you take over! </sp>
<sp> Cloud gets up. </sp>
<sp> CloudHey, you're right... I DO feel a little better driving.No sweat. Just leave everything to me. </sp>
<sp> BarretDon't worry!If it breaks down, I'll smack it one--that'll fix it! </sp>
<sp> TifaYou can do it, Cloud! </sp>
<sp> YuffieI'll hold my breath, so HURRY! </sp>
<sp> Cait SithOh please drive safely, Cloud! </sp>
<sp> VincentShinra's technology is really something. </sp>
<sp> CidI'll be watchin' from here! </sp>
<sp> SoldiersI thank you! I am happy to be a hostage!Piloting a submarine is very difficult! I am completely clueless! </sp>
<sp> CommanderHey! Who am I to know! </sp>
<sp> CloudWell, now what?- Read the manual- Sit in the seat- Leave it alone </sp>

  Read the manual

  Sit in the seat
  Cloud sits down.
  CloudEverything seems set...- Start the mission!This switch...?Main screen: ONChange the screen mode.


  Leave it alone
  Cloud shrugs.

<sp> Cloud and the others get on with the mission and shoot down the red leader sub. </sp>
<sp> CloudPhew--! We did it!!The Huge Materia should be at the bottom of the sea by now. Let's continue the search... </sp>
...All Shinra Submarine Units, do you read...?...All Shinra Submarine Units, do you read...?
<sp> CloudHmm...? ...Must be from Shinra. </sp>
...Report, No. 2...
<sp> BarretIs it us? </sp>
<sp> YuffieOh my gawd...! They mean us. </sp>
<sp> Cait SithWe need to respond! </sp>
<sp> VincentWe've no choice but to respond. </sp>
<sp> CloudAll right, I'll do it.This is Shinra No. 2... Everything's normal. </sp>
...Roger......Your next mission is......Return to Junon Dock......We will transport the Huge Materia from the airport......Those without other assignments will report for guard duty...That is all. Over and out...
<sp> CloudJunon Airport... We should make it if we hurry.Forget about the Huge Materia for now.We're climbing! </sp>
<sp> TifaAye, aye... CAPTAIN! </sp>
<sp> NanakiTake o-ff! </sp>
<sp> CidThe airport? No sweat! </sp>
<sp> They return to the surface and dock the submarine outside Junon. They hurry back to Junon. </sp>
<sp> FishermanIt seems like there's something going on again up there.Is that huge plane going to take off again with that deafening roar? </sp>
<sp> Older ManI just saw some Shinra soldiers all huddled together discussing something.They said a plane carrying Huge Materia would be taking off from the airport above. </sp>
<sp> They take the elevator to Upper Junon. </sp>
<sp> Soldier on the Path to the AirportFinished loading the Huge Materia!All we have to do now is to ready the cargo ship, 'Gelnika', for departure and we're done! </sp>
<sp> Cloud arrives at the airport only to watch Gelnika take off from Junon. </sp>
<sp> CloudOh no! The Huge Materia... </sp>
<sp> BarretLet's go after it! </sp>
<sp> YuffieLet's get there before they do and catch 'em! </sp>
<sp> Cait SithHow 'bout us getting there beforehand and stealing it back? </sp>
<sp> VincentLet's go after it. </sp>
<sp> TifaWhere are they headed? </sp>
<sp> NanakiWhere's their destination? </sp>
<sp> CidWhere's that thing headed? </sp>
<sp> CloudRocket Town, of course. </sp>
<sp> SoldierWhew... I hope everything goes all right until we get to Rocket Town. Then, our mission is nearly complete. </sp>
<sp> Soldier 2Not so fast. We still have one major task... we still have to transport the stuff... </sp>
<sp> SoldierThe stuff... </sp>
<sp> Soldier on the Path to the AirportI'm glad we got Gelnika to the Rocket Town safely.But they sure think big. Looks like they're going to use the Huge Materia's to break up Meteor... </sp>
<sp> Cloud and the others leave Junon. </sp>
<sp> Searching the ocean floor, they find the red submarine. </sp>
<sp> CloudSo this is the Leader Sub...Damn...... makes me sick just thinking about it... </sp>
...Huge Materia recovered......no damage appears to have been sustained...
<sp> Cloud...Phew... That's good to hear. </sp>
<sp> Received Key Item "Huge Materia"! </sp>
<sp> They also come across the sunken ship Gelnika. </sp>
<sp> CloudThis is the Shinra's Gelnika type airplane... I wonder why it went down here? </sp>
<sp> They enter a side room. </sp>
<sp> CloudWhat is this place...? Must be some kind of a Research Establishment because there's a Mako generator? </sp>
<sp> In the hallway, they encounter the Turks. </sp>
<sp> CloudTurks!? </sp>
<sp> Rude...again? </sp>
<sp> RenoWe just seem to keep running into each other lately!There were weapons and Materia developed solely to destroy Sephiroth. </sp>
<sp> Rude...but, it was attacked by Weapon and sunk to the bottom of the sea. </sp>
<sp> RenoI can't give you what's here. We'll take out Sephiroth.I guess this is our last meeting. </sp>
<sp> RudeI won't let you get in our way. </sp>
<sp> Cloud and the others fight the Turks. </sp>
<sp> RenoThese guys are pretty tough. </sp>
<sp> He runs off. </sp>
<sp> Rude.................. </sp>
<sp> He runs off after Reno. </sp>
<sp> CloudSo Shinra's new, secret weapon was on this Airship... </sp>
<sp> Into the room beyond... </sp>
<sp> CloudThis must be the Cargo Room...This is terrible... It's all messed up... </sp>
<sp> Cloud and the others salvage what they can from the Cargo Room and leave for Rocket Town. </sp>
