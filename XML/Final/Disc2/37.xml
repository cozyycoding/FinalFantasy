Back in Junon
Gelnika

<stage>Cloud and the others arrive at lower Junon.</stage>
<speaker name="Woman">Woman</speaker><boxstart/>They say Shinra's gathering Huge Materia from around the world and bringing it to Junon.<boxstart/>Bringing it to Junon must mean they want to use their airplanes.<boxstart/>I've noticed there's been a lot of Shinra ships recently. I think they're going to the off-shore Underwater Reactor.<boxstart/>Isn't Shinra trying to transport the Reactor's Huge Materia?
<speaker name="Older Man">Older Man</speaker><boxstart/>I remember years ago, seein' the Shinra build a long pipe underwater.<boxstart/>The underwater reactor is connected to Junon by a pipe.<boxstart/>You should be able to get to the reactor through it.
<speaker name="Priscilla">Priscilla</speaker><boxstart/>Who are you---?<boxstart/>Cloud!!<boxstart/>Stupid jerk! Look how much you made me worry!! Were you at the Lifestream?
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Yeah, that's right.
<speaker name="Priscilla">Priscilla</speaker><boxstart/>You've gotta be more careful! Because you're going to marry me one day.
<speaker name="Soldier by Elevator">Soldier by Elevator</speaker><boxstart/>If you want to get on the elevator that badly, give me 10 gil!
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>- Okay, I guess
<speaker name="Soldier by Elevator">Soldier by Elevator</speaker><boxstart/>Hurry up and get in!
<stage>Cloud takes the elevator to Upper Junon.</stage>
<speaker name="Soldier on the Path to the Airport">Soldier on the Path to the Airport</speaker><boxstart/>The Shinra's collecting Huge Materia at the Junon Undersea Reactor!<boxstart/>When they're done, they'll bring it to this airport.<boxstart/>Get out of here before you get in the way!<boxstart/>What... me? I'm gonna be watching from here, so that I don't get in their way either!
<stage>Cloud runs outside to the airport.</stage>
<speaker name="Soldier">Soldier</speaker><boxstart/>After they get it, they'll take it to the airport and will transport it to Rocket Town by Gelnika. Don't let your guard down!
<speaker name="Soldier 2">Soldier 2</speaker><boxstart/>They've finally started collecting the Huge Materia from the Junon Underwater Reactor.
<stage>Cloud leaves the base and starts down the street, then stops and turns to his companions.</stage>
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>I may be mistaken, but...... Doesn't it feel like we're missing something?
<stage>Cloud and the others continue on. On the way to the reactor, they come across a commander drilling his soldiers.</stage>
<speaker name="Commander">Commander</speaker><boxstart/>All right!! Let's see how hard you trained!<boxstart/>Attention! Charge--!!
<stage>The soldiers all charge in the opposite direction.</stage>
<speaker name="Commander">Commander</speaker><boxstart/>He... hey--!! That's the Underwater Reactor!! Come back!!
<stage>Cloud gets on the first elevator with two soldiers and a redhead.</stage>
<speaker name="Soldier">Soldier</speaker><boxstart/>How 'bout, whoever stays alive, gets to take her out?
<speaker name="Soldier 2">Soldier 2</speaker><boxstart/>All right, you're on!!<boxstart/>But... What if both of us...
<speaker name="Soldier">Soldier</speaker><boxstart/>Whoa!! Don't even talk about that!
<stage>Cloud defeats both of them.</stage>
<speaker name="Redhead">Redhead</speaker><boxstart/>...gulp... (Great... there went two perfectly good men!)
<stage>The elevator reaches the lower floor.</stage>
<speaker name="Soldier 3">Soldier 3</speaker><boxstart/>OK! Back to work!! Back to work!!
<speaker name="Soldier 4">Soldier 4</speaker><boxstart/>Yawn... I'm sleepy!!
<speaker name="Soldier 3">Soldier 3</speaker><boxstart/>For Junon!!
<stage>Cloud and the others continue on down another elevator and through the underwater pipe to the reactor.</stage>
<speaker name="Soldiers in Reactor">Soldiers in Reactor</speaker><boxstart/>You, you're Cloud!!<boxstart/>You are NOT getting this Huge Materia!!<boxstart/>So you WERE after the Huge Materia!
<stage>Cloud and the others reach where the Huge Materia is stored.</stage>
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>!? The Huge Materia!
<stage>They watch as a machine arm reaches down and pulls out the materia.</stage>
<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Hey! A Crane Game!
<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Damn, just missed it!
<speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>We were a little late...
<speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>That's what you think! ^%$@#&amp;$#!
<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>They're gonna take it on that submarine!
<speaker name="Nanaki">Nanaki</speaker><boxstart/>If we take a short cut, we might just make it......!
<speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>There's the submarine dock just ahead of us.
<stage>They run to the submarine docks. Reno is standing with his back to them, supervising.</stage>
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Did we make it!?
<stage>He watches as the Huge Materia is lowered into the red submarine.</stage>
<speaker name="Reno">Reno</speaker><boxstart/>What are you doing? Help load.
He turns around.
<boxstart/>Cloud!?
<speaker name="Nanaki">Nanaki</speaker><boxstart/>Help?
<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>We're gonna help transport the Huge Materia... Reno!
<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>I'm SURE! You want me to do manual labor?
<speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>You know I don't work for cheap!
<speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>I refuse...
<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>Looks like we barely made it.
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Either give it to us or else.<boxstart/>...which is it gonna be?
<speaker name="Reno">Reno</speaker><boxstart/>Unfortunately, I don't have time to deal with you.<boxstart/>My priority is the Huge Materia!
<stage>He runs off, leaving Cloud and the others to fight a robot. After the battle, they find the red sub has already left.</stage>
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Damn! The submarine!
<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>!? The Huge Materia!
<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Damn! So they was just buyin' time!?
<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>We have to go after it!
<speaker name="Nanaki">Nanaki</speaker><boxstart/>But it's already in the water!
<speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>It left the dock!
<speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>There is one way...
<speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>Hold on to your horses! Let's get it from them!!
<stage>They run for the other submarine, and the soldiers on board turn frantic.</stage>
<speaker name="Soldiers">Soldiers</speaker><boxstart/>Y, you...!<boxstart/>You're not taking over this ship!
<stage>They defeat the soldiers and get on board.</stage>
<speaker name="Soldiers">Soldiers</speaker><boxstart/>You want the Sub? Just try an' take it!<boxstart/>Um... sir! Maybe we shouldn't piss them off...
<stage>They fight off these soldiers, too.</stage>
<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Come on, Cloud! Follow me!<boxstart/>Damn, man!! ......what the...?<boxstart/>Hey yo! Remember I was the leader first, man!<boxstart/>Yo! We come a long ways since we got on that train!<boxstart/>Lotsa things changed! This and that.
<stage>They enter the bridge.</stage>
<speaker name="Commander">Commander</speaker><boxstart/>NO, NO!! This is terrible!
<speaker name="Soldiers">Soldiers</speaker><boxstart/>We don't have much time left! I don't want to die!<boxstart/>There's still so much more I've got to do!<boxstart/>I never even got to do my special victory dance in battle!
<speaker name="Commander">Commander</speaker><boxstart/>All right!! Then make this your first victory!!<boxstart/>Go on, show 'em!!
<speaker name="Soldiers">Soldiers</speaker><boxstart/>Yes, sir!!

  <speaker name="Soldier 2">Soldier 2</speaker><boxstart/>The Special Pose...


  <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>Take them prisoner
  <stage>The soldiers move aside to let Cloud and the others into the control room.</stage>

<stage>Cloud crouches down, wringing his hands. Yuffie doesn't look any better off.</stage>
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Someone... please. I'm sorry I can't take it anymore.<boxstart/>The lack of space, the shaking, the roar of the engine...
<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Stop your blubberin'!! How we gonna move this without you?
<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>I... I can't... I'm history.
<speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>I can't fit in this seat... No good!
<speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>Better hurry. Reno's getting away.
<stage>Tifa, Nanaki, or Cid goes up to the control panel and presses a button.</stage>
<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>See!?<boxstart/>Just fiddle with the controls, and we'll get somewhere!<boxstart/>Hey Cloud? Why don't you try piloting it?<boxstart/>They say you don't get motion sickness if you're driving.
<speaker name="Nanaki">Nanaki</speaker><boxstart/>It moved!<boxstart/>Cloud!! Try it!
<speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>Hunka junk... just gotta do this!<boxstart/>SEE! Now you take over!
<stage>Cloud gets up.</stage>
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Hey, you're right... I DO feel a little better driving.<boxstart/>No sweat. Just leave everything to me.
<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Don't worry!<boxstart/>If it breaks down, I'll smack it one--that'll fix it!
<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>You can do it, Cloud!
<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>I'll hold my breath, so HURRY!
<speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>Oh please drive safely, Cloud!
<speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>Shinra's technology is really something.
<speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>I'll be watchin' from here!
<speaker name="Soldiers">Soldiers</speaker><boxstart/>I thank you! I am happy to be a hostage!<boxstart/>Piloting a submarine is very difficult! I am completely clueless!
<speaker name="Commander">Commander</speaker><boxstart/>Hey! Who am I to know!
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Well, now what?<boxstart/>- Read the manual<boxstart/>- Sit in the seat<boxstart/>- Leave it alone

  Mission Orders: Presently on the ocean floor near Junon, a Red Leader Submarine carrying Huge Materia is being escorted by covert Shinra Submarine Units.<boxstart/>Furthermore, it has been confirmed that several mines have been dispersed onto the ocean floor.<boxstart/>The ocean floor can only be monitored with Shinra's Sonar Radar Screen.<boxstart/>Enemy subs can only be detected with the Sonar area. Get in front of the detected enemy sub and "Lock On"!!<boxstart/>Push [] button to fire the torpedo!<boxstart/>The mines are found on the radar screen at the top of the indicators. The mines inflict great damage, so be careful!<boxstart/>Objective: Sink the Red Leader Submarine carrying the Huge Materia! Time Limit: 10 minutes!


  <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>Sit in the seat
  <stage>Cloud sits down.</stage>
  <speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Everything seems set...<boxstart/>- Start the mission!<boxstart/>This switch...?<boxstart/>Main screen: ON<boxstart/>Change the screen mode.


  Leave it alone
  <stage>Cloud shrugs.</stage>

<stage>Cloud and the others get on with the mission and shoot down the red leader sub.</stage>
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Phew--! We did it!!<boxstart/>The Huge Materia should be at the bottom of the sea by now. Let's continue the search...
...All Shinra Submarine Units, do you read...?<boxstart/>...All Shinra Submarine Units, do you read...?
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Hmm...? ...Must be from Shinra.
...Report, No. 2...
<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Is it us?
<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Oh my gawd...! They mean us.
<speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>We need to respond!
<speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>We've no choice but to respond.
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>All right, I'll do it.<boxstart/>This is Shinra No. 2... Everything's normal.
...Roger...<boxstart/>...Your next mission is...<boxstart/>...Return to Junon Dock...<boxstart/>...We will transport the Huge Materia from the airport...<boxstart/>...Those without other assignments will report for guard duty...<boxstart/>That is all. Over and out...
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Junon Airport... We should make it if we hurry.<boxstart/>Forget about the Huge Materia for now.<boxstart/>We're climbing!
<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>Aye, aye... CAPTAIN!
<speaker name="Nanaki">Nanaki</speaker><boxstart/>Take o-ff!
<speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>The airport? No sweat!
<stage>They return to the surface and dock the submarine outside Junon. They hurry back to Junon.</stage>
<speaker name="Fisherman">Fisherman</speaker><boxstart/>It seems like there's something going on again up there.<boxstart/>Is that huge plane going to take off again with that deafening roar?
<speaker name="Older Man">Older Man</speaker><boxstart/>I just saw some Shinra soldiers all huddled together discussing something.<boxstart/>They said a plane carrying Huge Materia would be taking off from the airport above.
<stage>They take the elevator to Upper Junon.</stage>
<speaker name="Soldier on the Path to the Airport">Soldier on the Path to the Airport</speaker><boxstart/>Finished loading the Huge Materia!<boxstart/>All we have to do now is to ready the cargo ship, 'Gelnika', for departure and we're done!
<stage>Cloud arrives at the airport only to watch Gelnika take off from Junon.</stage>
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Oh no! The Huge Materia...
<speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Let's go after it!
<speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Let's get there before they do and catch 'em!
<speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>How 'bout us getting there beforehand and stealing it back?
<speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>Let's go after it.
<speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>Where are they headed?
<speaker name="Nanaki">Nanaki</speaker><boxstart/>Where's their destination?
<speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>Where's that thing headed?
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Rocket Town, of course.
<speaker name="Soldier">Soldier</speaker><boxstart/>Whew... I hope everything goes all right until we get to Rocket Town. Then, our mission is nearly complete.
<speaker name="Soldier 2">Soldier 2</speaker><boxstart/>Not so fast. We still have one major task... we still have to transport the stuff...
<speaker name="Soldier">Soldier</speaker><boxstart/>The stuff...
<speaker name="Soldier on the Path to the Airport">Soldier on the Path to the Airport</speaker><boxstart/>I'm glad we got Gelnika to the Rocket Town safely.<boxstart/>But they sure think big. Looks like they're going to use the Huge Materia's to break up Meteor...
<stage>Cloud and the others leave Junon.</stage>
<stage>Searching the ocean floor, they find the red submarine.</stage>
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>So this is the Leader Sub...<boxstart/>Damn...... makes me sick just thinking about it...
...Huge Materia recovered...<boxstart/>...no damage appears to have been sustained...
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>...Phew... That's good to hear.
Received Key Item "Huge Materia"!
<stage>They also come across the sunken ship Gelnika.</stage>
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>This is the Shinra's Gelnika type airplane... I wonder why it went down here?
<stage>They enter a side room.</stage>
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>What is this place...? Must be some kind of a Research Establishment because there's a Mako generator?
<stage>In the hallway, they encounter the Turks.</stage>
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Turks!?
<speaker name="Rude">Rude</speaker><boxstart/>...again?
<speaker name="Reno">Reno</speaker><boxstart/>We just seem to keep running into each other lately!<boxstart/>There were weapons and Materia developed solely to destroy Sephiroth.
<speaker name="Rude">Rude</speaker><boxstart/>...but, it was attacked by Weapon and sunk to the bottom of the sea.
<speaker name="Reno">Reno</speaker><boxstart/>I can't give you what's here. We'll take out Sephiroth.<boxstart/>I guess this is our last meeting.
<speaker name="Rude">Rude</speaker><boxstart/>I won't let you get in our way.
<stage>Cloud and the others fight the Turks.</stage>
<speaker name="Reno">Reno</speaker><boxstart/>These guys are pretty tough.
He runs off.
<speaker name="Rude">Rude</speaker><boxstart/>..................
He runs off after Reno.
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>So Shinra's new, secret weapon was on this Airship...
<stage>Into the room beyond...</stage>
<speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>This must be the Cargo Room...<boxstart/>This is terrible... It's all messed up...
<stage>Cloud and the others salvage what they can from the Cargo Room and leave for Rocket Town.</stage>
