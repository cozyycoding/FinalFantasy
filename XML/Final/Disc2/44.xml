<sp> The Highwind - What We're Fighting For </sp>

<sp> Cloud's Speech </sp>
<sp> Cloud and Tifa Await the Others' Return </sp>
<sp> Back on the Highwind </sp>

<sp> On the Highwind's bridge... </sp>
<sp> Cait SithShinra's...... finished. </sp>
<sp> CloudMeteor's gonna fall in about...... </sp>
<sp> NanakiSeven more days. That's what Grandfather said. </sp>
<sp> CloudNanaki......You want to see everyone in Cosmo Canyon again? </sp>
<sp> Nanaki.........yes. </sp>
<sp> Cloud (turning to Barret)You want to see Marlene, right? </sp>
<sp> BarretDon't ask me that. </sp>
<sp> CloudWe'll beat Sephiroth...Then, if we don't release the power of Holy in seven days......There won't be a planet left to protect.If we can't beat Sephiroth...It's as good as death for us.We'll just go a few days sooner than the rest who'll die from Meteor. </sp>
<sp> BarretDon't be thinkin' you're gonna lose before ya even fight! </sp>
<sp> CloudNo!What I meant was...What are we all fighting for? I want us all to understand that.Save the planet... for the future of the planet... Sure, that's all fine.But really, is that really how it is?For me, this is a personal feud.I want to beat Sephiroth. And settle my past.Saving the planet just happens to be part of that.I've been thinking.I think we all are fighting for ourselves.For ourselves... and that someone... something... whatever it is, that's important to us.That's what we're fighting for.That's why we keep up this battle for the planet. </sp>
<sp> BarretYou're right...It sounds cool sayin' it's to save the planet.But I was the one who blew up that Mako reactor......Lookin' back on it now, I can see that wasn't the right way to do things.I made a lot of friends and innocent bystanders suffer......At first, it was revenge against Shinra. For attackin' my town.But now......Yeah. I'm fightin' for Marlene.For Marlene... For Marlene's future...Yeah... I guess I want to save the planet for Marlene's sake... </sp>
<sp> CloudGo and see her. Make sure you're right, and come back.All of you. Get off the ship and find out your reasons for yourselves.I want you to make sure. Then I want you to come back. </sp>
<sp> CidMaybe ain't none of us'll come back.Meteor's gonna kill us all anyway. Let's just forget any useless struggling! </sp>
<sp> CloudI know why I'm fighting.I'm fighting to save the planet, and that's that.But besides that, there's something personal too...A very personal memory that I have.What about you all?I want all of you to find that something within yourselves.If you don't find it, then that's okay too.You can't fight without a reason, right?So, I won't hold it against you if you don't come back. </sp>
<sp> Everyone leaves but Tifa. Cloud turns to her. </sp>
<sp> CloudWhat are you going to do, Tifa? </sp>
<sp> TifaDid you forget?I'm... all alone. I don't have anywhere to go. </sp>
<sp> Cloud and Tifa climb down from the airship. </sp>
<sp> TifaEveryone's gone... </sp>
<sp> CloudYeah, we don't have anywhere or anyone to go home to. </sp>
<sp> TifaYou're right...But... I'm sure someday... they'll come back, don't you think? </sp>
<sp> CloudHmm... I wonder...?Everyone has an irreplaceable something they're holding on to...But this time, our opponent... </sp>
<sp> TifaHmm... But that's all right, even if no one comes back.As long as I'm with you... As long as you're by my side... I won't give up even if I'm scared. </sp>
<sp> Cloud.........Tifa...... </sp>
<sp> TifaNo matter how close we are... We were far apart... before this.But when we were in the Lifestream surrounded by all those screams of anguish, I thought I heard your voice......sniff... you probably don't remember this...But deep in my heart I heard you calling my name... Or at least I thought I did... </sp>
<sp> Depending on Cloud's actions throughout the game, the dialogue continues differently. </sp>

  If Cloud has favored Tifa...
  CloudYeah... At that time I heard you calling me.You were calling me back from the stream of consciousness in the Lifestream.After all, I promised. That if anything were to ever happen to you, I would come to help.
  TifaCloud...? Do you think the stars can hear us?Do you think they see how hard we're fighting for them?
  CloudI dunno... But...Whether they are or not, we still have to do what we can. And believe in ourselves...I'll find the answer someday. Right, Tifa?That's what I learned from you when I was in the Lifestream.
  TifaYeah...... that's right... 
  CloudHey Tifa...... I...... There are a lot of things I wanted to talk to you about.But now that we're together like this, I don't know what I really wanted to say...I guess nothing's changed at all... Kind of makes you want to laugh...
  TifaCloud... Words aren't the only thing that tell people what you're thinking...
  Cloud............
  Cloud and Tifa spend the night on the ground beneath the airship, Tifa leaning against Cloud.
  Cloud............It's almost dawn...
  TifaH, huh...?
  CloudSorry. Did I wake you...? It's almost dawn, Tifa.
  TifaUmm... G, good morning... Cloud.Give me a little longer... Just a little bit longer...
  She leans back against him.
  This day will never come again... So let me have this moment...
  CloudYeah... okay.This is probably the last time we'll have together......


  If Cloud has favored one of the others...
  CloudI see......I think I've heard about it, too.At that time, it was Tifa's voice......
  TifaCloud...? Do you think the stars can hear us?Do you think they see how hard we're fighting for them?
  CloudI dunno... But...Whether they are or not, we still have to do what we can. And believe in ourselves...I'll find the answer someday. As long as I keep trying.
  TifaYeah...... that's right...
  CloudWe've got a big battle tomorrow, we'd better get some sleep...
  TifaUmm. Yes, I guess you're right......
  Cloud and Tifa spend the night on the ground beneath the airship, Tifa leaning against Cloud.
  Cloud............It's almost dawn...
  TifaH, huh...?
  CloudMorning, Tifa. It's almost dawn...
  TifaMmm...... Good morning, Cloud.Give me a little longer... Just a little big longer...
  She leans back against him.
  This day will never come again... So let me have this moment...
  Cloud............

<sp> Later, some time after the sun has risen. </sp>
<sp> Tifa......... </sp>
<sp> CloudWe'd better go. </sp>
<sp> TifaBut, I still...!? </sp>
<sp> CloudIt's all right, Tifa. You said so yourself yesterday.At least we don't have to go on alone. </sp>
<sp> TifaYes... That's right! </sp>
<sp> CloudOkay! Let's go! </sp>
<sp> Together they return to the Highwind. </sp>
<sp> TifaThe airship is too big for just the two of us.Yeah, it's a little lonely without everyone. </sp>
<sp> CloudDon't worry. It'll be okay.I'll make a big enough ruckus for everyone.Besides, I'm the pilot.No more flying around casually like before.We won't have time to feel lonely. </sp>
<sp> Tifa nods. Suddenly the airship starts up. </sp>
<sp> TifaHuh!? </sp>
<sp> CloudIt's moving...... </sp>
<sp> They run to the bridge, where they find Cid and Barret at the controls. </sp>
<sp> CloudBarret! Cid! </sp>
<sp> BarretO, oh...... is that okay with you? </sp>
<sp> Nanaki bounds up from the stairs. </sp>
<sp> CloudNanaki! </sp>
<sp> TifaWhy didn't you tell me!? </sp>
<sp> NanakiBut, you know, Cid. </sp>
<sp> CidHey, Nanaki.If you butt in now, you never know what they'll say later...... </sp>
<sp> Tifa......Were you listening? </sp>
<sp> She runs off, embarrassed. Cloud turns away, scratching his head, and notices Vincent. </sp>
<sp> CloudVincent! </sp>
<sp> Everyone turns to look. Vincent turns away. </sp>
<sp> VincentWhy such a puzzled look?You don't want me to come? </sp>
<sp> CloudNo, it's just that you're always so cold. I thought you didn't care what was happening. </sp>
<sp> VincentCool?Hmm...... I guess that's just how I am, sorry. </sp>
<sp> He jumps over to his usual spot. </sp>
<sp> BarretWell lookey-here. The Shinra Manager's come back. </sp>
<sp> Cait SithUh, excuse me but...I wanted to come with the main group, but I couldn't get away......So some people in Midgar took me in.I know I have a stuffed animal body, but I'll work really hard! </sp>
<sp> BarretI guess that's everyone. </sp>
<sp> NanakiNo, Yuffie's missing. </sp>
<sp> BarretShe ain't gonna show up.'Least this time she didn't steal our materia. Guess we gotta be thankful for that. </sp>
<sp> Yuffie drops down from the ceiling and shakes her fist at him. </sp>
<sp> YuffieHow could you say that!?I came all the way here after being seasick as a dog!I didn't go through all that just to have you guys have the best parts all to yourselves! </sp>
<sp> CloudWelcome back, Yuffie. </sp>
<sp> YuffieGee, Cloud...... that's so nice of you to say that. ......You sick?Well, whatever. I'm gonna be in my reserved seat in the hall...... waiting...... upp! ......Urk! </sp>
<sp> She runs out of the bridge. </sp>
<sp> CloudThanks everyone. </sp>
<sp> BarretWe didn't come back for your spikey headed ass!We came back for Marlene. Guess it's jes' my...... whatcha call, feelings or somethin'.I, uh, I ain't got now words now...... </sp>
<sp> Nanaki......Although she's not here, she left us a window of opportunity... </sp>
<sp> CidWe can't let it go like this. </sp>
<sp> Cloud......Aerith.She was smiling to the end.We have to do something, or that smile will just freeze like that.Let's all go together.Memories of Aerith......Although she should've returned to the planet by now, something stopped her and now she's stuck......We've got to let go of Aerith's memory. </sp>
<sp> CidHas anyone here changed their mind? </sp>
<sp> CloudI'm counting on you, Cid. </sp>
<sp> CidYeah, yeah......There are 2 levers here that've been buggin' me for a while now...Let me try them out.All right, so what should I do?You decide, Cloud. </sp>
<sp> CloudThis is our last battle.Our target is the North Cave. Our enemy is...... Sephiroth!So let's move out! </sp>
<sp> Cid pulls the levers and the Highwind blasts off. </sp>
<sp> CloudWe're almost to the North Cave! We're on our way, Sephiroth! </sp>
<sp> CidMan, I'm going to stick it to him! </sp>
<sp> A warning sounds. </sp>
<sp> CloudWhat is it, Cid? </sp>
<sp> CidErrrrggh! Some incredible force! Losing... control......! </sp>
<sp> Cid's crew runs over to help him. </sp>
<sp> CidGet the hell outta here, flunkies! Didn't I tell you all to go home!? </sp>
<sp> CrewYes, sir. This is our home!! </sp>
<sp> CidOh ma--......stop trying to act so cool.All right, you jokers! Hold me down with everything you got!!Geronimo!! </sp>
