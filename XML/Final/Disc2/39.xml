<sp> RedheadListen to me! Something really big's happening in Midgar.They were just saying on TV it was Rufus second strategy and...That big cannon's pointed due north...... You think the target's...... Sephiroth? </sp>
<sp> ManSephiroth put up a huge barrier around the North Crater.Rufus wants to use a mammoth cannon to smash the barrier.He plans to have Shinra troops rush in and attack Sephiroth after the barrier falls. </sp>
<sp> Inside the second house... </sp>
<sp> Old ManEveryone at Shinra's in an uproar because they heard Weapon's coming.I heard a big hydroplane carrying secret weapons, got attacked by Weapon and was sunk at sea...... </sp>

<sp> At Lower Junon... </sp>
<sp> WomanI heard a war's about to start! And that's why they're moving the big cannon! </sp>
<sp> Older ManListen Cloud, I'm over the hill, but Priscilla is still a child.Isn't there a way to protect at least her from Meteor? </sp>
<sp> In Upper Junon... </sp>
<sp> SoldierThe Shinra Army's gathered at Midgar. Now it's just a matter of time Sephiroth's dead.What... me? I don't mind. I'll just wait here. My life is important to me. </sp>

<sp> At North Corel... </sp>
<sp> Man in HardhatHey, the Gold Saucer reopened!We've got to play hard to get our minds of Meteor. </sp>
<sp> At the ropeway station... </sp>
<sp> RedheadI'm gonna use all my life savings before Meteor hits! </sp>
<sp> BlondI know how you feel, but what if Meteor doesn't hit us? What are you gonna do then? </sp>
<sp> Station ManThe Gold Saucer reopened. Why don't you go play hard and clear your heads as well as your pockets? </sp>

<sp> At Gold Saucer... </sp>
<sp> DioI thought about it, but there was only one conclusion.I believed that because of the way things are, there's a need for a place like this.Enjoy yourselves... Ha ha ha ha... </sp>
<sp> By this point, Cloud may be able to access the special duel at the Battle Arena. </sp>
<sp> ReceptionistYou know, I've been thinking about it for a while now, but you must be pretty strong?Probably strong enough to take on the top 1 or 2 fighters?Maybe you'll be good enough for the big match......How 'bout it? There's a private battle only for the strongest. Wanna try? </sp>
<sp> Cloud- Let's do it- Not interested </sp>
<sp> Woman Outside Battle SquareI watched you win eight battles. I want you to have this! </sp>
