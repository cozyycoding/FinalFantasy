# WHC 3/17/21: Presumably you'll also have <speaker> elements within the <speech> elements.
# To identify the speakers, you have some options.
# You could use attribute values: <speaker id="Bob">Bob</speaker>
# That would make the XPaths easier, as you only have to descend to the attribute axis.
# You could easily achieve that using Regex capturing groups.
# Also, you can then use your schema to limit the allowable names of the speakers.
# This is advantageous in case there is a typo or difference at some point; it would flag that.
# I would recommend you do that.
# However, if you are absolutely sure that the speakers' names are identical every time, 
# and you don't mind having to descend to the text() node in your XPaths and using the matches() function,,
# you do have the option of just doing <speaker>Bob</speaker>.

# What are your plans so far for tagging the "option" speeches that depend on input?
# Just start with something; you can always change it later, with XSLT, Regex, etc.
